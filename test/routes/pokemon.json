            "description": "Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal amphibian Pok\u00e9mon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth. Small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On Bulbasaur's back is a green plant bulb that conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines, which is grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb also provides it with energy through photosynthesis and from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.\nFirst partner Pok\u00e9mon are raised by Breeders to be distributed to new Trainers . Having been raised by humans from birth, Bulbasaur is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pok\u00e9mon. It is known to be extremely loyal, even after long-term abandonment. Bulbasaur have demonstrated a nurturing instinct towards younger, weaker Pok\u00e9mon, one individual even using its vines to pick up a crying Pok\u00e9mon, gently rocking it back and forth through the air while singing a \"Bulba-by\". Its vines are long and strong enough to allow Bulbasaur to grab the branches of trees and pull itself up to reach berries. Bulbasaur can survive for days without even eating a single morsel. As mentioned in Sleep Style Dex , Bulbasaur is known to sleep in sunny spots.\nIt is found in grasslands and forests throughout the Kanto region . However, due to Bulbasaur's status as first partner Pok\u00e9mon, it is hard to come by in the wild and generally found under the ownership of a Trainer. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy . A Bulbasaur's bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve. If it does not want to evolve, it struggles to resist the transformation. Many Bulbasaur gather every year in a hidden garden in Kanto to evolve into Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a Venusaur.",

On top of its head are pointed ears with black insides, and it has narrow red eyes. Ivysaur has a short, rounded snout with a wide mouth and two pointed teeth in its upper jaw. Each of its feet has three claws on them. The bulb on its back has bloomed into a giant pink bud. A short brown trunk surrounded by leafy green fronds supports the bud.\nThe weight of the plant prevents Ivysaur from running fast and standing on its hind legs, forcing its legs to grow sturdy. When its flower is ready to bloom, it gives off a distinct, sweet-smelling aroma and starts swelling. Ivysaur will also start spending more time in sunlight in preparation for its upcoming evolution. Exposure to sunlight adds to the strength of both Ivysaur and its plant. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Ivysaur is known to sleep in sunny spots while undergoing its photosynthesis process. Researchers cannot decide if Ivysaur is awake or asleep during this process. Ivysaur are typically found in plains .",

Its mouth is wide with two pointed teeth in the upper jaw and four in the lower jaw. On top of its head are small, pointed ears with reddish-pink insides. It has three clawed toes on each foot. The bud on its back has bloomed into a large pink, white-spotted flower. The flower is supported by a thick, brown trunk surrounded by green fronds. A female Venusaur has a gynoecium in the center of its flower.\nVenusaur uses its flower to catch the sun's rays to convert them into energy, which causes the flower to become more vibrant. The flower releases a soothing scent that attracts Pok\u00e9mon and calms emotions. This scent becomes stronger after a rainy day. Venusaur is at its strongest in the summertime when there is much more sunlight to absorb. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Venusaur releases a soothing fragrance while sleeping. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Bulbasaur's Mysterious Garden , Venusaur has demonstrated the ability to manipulate nature, release several vines from its back, and lead evolution ceremonies for Bulbasaur and Ivysaur . This Pok\u00e9mon is rarely found in the wild, but it has been known to inhabit grasslands .",

            "description": "Charmander is a bipedal, reptilian Pok\u00e9mon with a primarily orange body and blue eyes. Its underside from the chest down and the soles of its feet are cream-colored. It has two small fangs visible in its upper jaw and two smaller fangs in its lower jaw. A fire burns at the tip of this Pok\u00e9mon's slender tail, which has blazed there since Charmander's birth.\nThe flame can indicate Charmander's health and mood, burning brightly when the Pok\u00e9mon is strong, weakly when it is exhausted, wavering when it is happy, and blazing when it is enraged. It is said that Charmander would die if its flame were to go out. However, if the Pok\u00e9mon is healthy, the flame will continue to burn even if it gets a bit wet and is said to steam in the rain. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Charmander is known to sleep while curled up. Supposedly, Charmander is drawing warmth from the flame on its tail. During quiet nights, one can hear the sound of a flame burning if you listen hard enough while Charmander sleeps.\nCharmander can be found in hot, mountainous areas . It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy . However, it is found far more often in Trainers ownership. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Snap and New Pok\u00e9mon Snap , Charmander exhibits pack behavior, calling others of its species if it finds food and watching the flames on each other's tails to ensure they don't go out.",

Its short legs have plantigrade feet with three claws and cream-colored soles. The tip of its long, powerful tail has a flame burning on it. The temperature rises to unbearable levels if Charmeleon swings its tail.\nCharmeleon has a vicious, hotheaded nature and will constantly seek out opponents. Strong opponents excite this Pok\u00e9mon, causing it to spout bluish-white flames that torch its surroundings. Charmeleon enjoys tormenting the opponents it fights. However, it will relax once it has won a battle . It is rare in the wild but can be found in mountainous areas . As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Charmleon is known to sleep with a laid-back posture, using its hands as a pillow. Its fierce fervor disappears when it sleeps.",

            "description": "Charizard is a draconic , bipedal Pok\u00e9mon . It is primarily orange with a cream underside from the chest to the tip of its tail. It has a long neck, small blue eyes, slightly raised nostrils, and two horn-like structures protruding from the back of its rectangular head. Two fangs are visible in its upper jaw when its mouth is closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the top of the third joint of each wing. A single wing finger is visible through the center of each wing membrane. Charizard's arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three white claws. In Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green , Charizard is seemingly shown holding a fireball, implying that it's capable of manipulating its flames using its hands; this is seen in media where it uses Fire Punch . It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of its plantigrade feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with a sizable flame, which can intensify to a blue flame if Charizard is irritated.\nCharizard typically inhabits mountains and valleys , such as the Charicific Valley in Johto . However, Charizard can also live in volcanoes, forming packs with other members of its family, including Charmander . In Pok\u00e9mon Snap , it's shown that Charizard are fully capable of living inside lava within volcanic craters.\nCharizard flies in search of powerful opponents to battle, and its fire will burn hotter as it gains experience. Its fiery breath can melt boulders and massive glaciers and has been known to cause forest fires accidentally. Though its fiery breath is hot, it never turns it on any opponent weaker than itself. The Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Charizard's Burning Ambitions showed that only a weak Charizard would show off its power. The side story episode Those Darn Electabuzz! showed that Charizard can swim underwater, with Pok\u00e9mon Origins further showing that the flame on the tip of the tail can still keep burning underwater. Charizard's wings can carry it to an altitude of 4,600 feet (1,400 meters), but the An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS notes that its droppings were found on Mt. Fuji , implying it could fly thrice as high. In Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , as well as media like the animated series , Charizard is known to sleep in an incredibly relaxed position, as it is very confident in its power. Some Charizard are occasionally seen sleeping flat on their backs, which is potentially a sign that those Charizard are especially strong.\nEven though Charizard originally couldn't learn the move Fly , Trainers have been shown riding Charizard in official artwork dating back to the 1997 Carddass Trading Cards . Ash himself was shown riding his Charizard already in the second season of the original series of Pok\u00e9mon the Series . Eventually, in Pok\u00e9mon Yellow , Charizard became able to learn Fly and has since been frequently depicted as a Pok\u00e9mon able to carry people on its back to fly them to distant areas. In Alola , Charizard is a Ride Pok\u00e9mon called Charizard Glide, being used by the natives to fly around the region or make deliveries.",

            "description": "Squirtle is a small reptilian Pok\u00e9mon that resembles a light-blue turtle . While it typically walks on its two short legs, it has been shown to run on all fours in Super Smash Bros. Brawl . It has large, purplish, or reddish eyes and a slightly hooked upper lip. Each of its hands and feet has three pointed digits. The end of its long, squirrel-like tail curls inward. Its body is encased by a tough shell that forms and hardens after birth. This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white ridge between the two halves.\nSquirtle's shell is a useful tool. It can withdraw into the shell for protection or to sleep. The grooved, rounded shape helps to reduce water resistance, allowing the Pok\u00e9mon to swim at high speeds. Squirtle can spray foamy water from its mouth with great accuracy. Squirtle is scarce in the wild, although it can be found around small ponds and lakes . Squirtle can also be found residing around rivers in mountainous regions, as shown in Pok\u00e9mon Snap and Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet . In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Beach Blank-Out Blastoise , Squirtle is shown to be found living on secluded islands with other members of their evolutionary line. Sharpedo is a natural predator of Squirtle. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Squirtle is known to sleep by withdrawing its limbs and head into its shell. It does this to protect itself from threats while sleeping. It also occasionally rocks contentedly from side to side while sleeping.\nIn Generation II , Squirtle and its evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Skull Bash naturally, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .",

            "description": "Wartortle is a bipedal, indigo reptilian Pok\u00e9mon similar to a turtle . It has brown eyes, a dark blue streak on each cheek, and two sharp teeth protruding from its upper jaw. It has three clawed fingers and pointed toes. On each side of its head are feather-like ears covered in pale blue fur. A brown shell with a pale yellow underside encases its body. A thick, white rim separates the upper and lower halves of the shell. An older Wartortle may have scars and algae growing on its shell. Poking out of the bottom of the shell is a thick, wavy tail that also has light blue fur and cannot be fully withdrawn into its shell. Its tail fur will darken with age. Its tail symbolizes longevity and good luck, making this Pok\u00e9mon popular with the elderly.\nBecause it is larger than Squirtle and has a larger shell, Wartortle has a more difficult time walking on land and keeping its balance in the water. Wartortle moves its furry ears and tail as both rudders and balancing rods to maintain balance while swimming at high speeds. Air can be stored in its fur for extended underwater diving. It hides in water when hunting and emerges to surprise its prey. It's shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Beach Blank-Out Blastoise that Wartortle can be found living in colonies on islands. Still, its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes . As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , is known to sleep with its body tucked into its shell while remaining wary of threats. It leaves its long, furry tail poking out a bit to feel out its surroundings in case of danger.\nIn Generation II , Wartortle and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Skull Bash naturally, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .",

This shell has a cream-colored underside and a white ridge encircling its arms and separating the upper and lower halves. Two powerful water cannons/jet nozzles reside at the top of its shell over its shoulders. These cannons can be extended or withdrawn. Blastoise's head has triangular ears that are black on the inside, small brown eyes, and a cream-colored lower jaw. Its arms are thick, and it has three claws on each hand. Its feet have three claws on the front and one on the back. Poking out of the bottom of its shell is a stubby tail.\nThe powerful cannons on this Pok\u00e9mon's back can produce water blasts that can pierce steel and concrete and be used for high-speed charges. The speed of Blastoise's charges is similar to the force of a rocket. Blastoise makes itself heavy to withstand these powerful blasts and crush its opponents. It is shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Beach Blank-Out Blastoise that Blastoise can take the role of a leader in large groups of Squirtle and Wartortle . Its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes . As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Blastoise is known to sleep soundly while protected by its tough shell. Blastoise has also been seen sleeping with its belly exposed on very rare occasions. This is due to Blastoise feeling completely secure in its surroundings and quickly falling asleep.\nIn Generation II , Blastoise and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Skull Bash naturally, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .",

            "description": "Caterpie is an insect Pok\u00e9mon that resembles a green caterpillar with a yellow underside and teardrop-shaped tail. Yellow ring-shaped markings down the sides of its segmented body resemble its eyes and are meant to scare off predators. Its most notable characteristic is the bright red antenna ( osmeterium ) on its head, which releases a stench to repel predators. Despite these features and its camouflage in green foliage, Caterpie is often preyed upon by Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon. Its four tiny feet are tipped with suction cups, permitting this Pok\u00e9mon to scale most surfaces with minimal effort.\nCaterpie is easy to capture and grows quickly, making it ideal for new Trainers . As Caterpie grow and develop over time, they will shed their skin many times before finally cocooning themselves in thick silk. It can also spit this silk to entangle foes as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Ash Catches a Pok\u00e9mon . It has a voracious appetite, driving it to eat a hundred leaves daily. It will even eat leaves bigger than itself. According to the 54th chapter of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , its favorite food is the Vermilion flower. Caterpie lives in temperate forests and jungles . As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Caterpie is known to sleep occasionally while using String Shot . On occasion, it drools out strings instead of saliva .",

            "description": "Metapod is an insect Pok\u00e9mon that resembles a green chrysalis . Its body is crescent-shaped, with several segments making up the lower point. The front of Metapod's shell resembles a face with heavy-lidded eyes and a sharply pointed nose. The back of its shell consists of several geometrically shaped portions and projections.\nMetapod's soft body is protected by a hard outer shell as it undergoes metamorphosis . While this shell is said to be as hard as steel, a sudden, powerful impact could cause its liquid innards to pop out, leaving it completely exposed. Metapod generally remains motionless, rebuilding its cells for evolution. If an enemy discovers Metapod, it cannot do anything other than harden its outer shell. Metapod lives in temperate forests and jungles , often in groups. Pikipek is a natural predator of Metapod. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Metapod is known to sleep while using the move Harden constantly to protect its innards. It stays still while sleeping to avoid getting attacked by foes .",

            "description": "Butterfree is a lepidopteran insect Pok\u00e9mon which resembles a vaguely anthropomorphic butterfly with a purple body. Unlike true insects, it only has two body segments and four light blue legs. The upper pair of its legs resemble small, three-fingered hands, while the lower pair resembles long, digit-less feet. Butterfree has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes. Its two pairs of wings are white with black venation . Two oval scales on a female Butterfree's lower wings are black, but they are white on a male.\nThe wings of Butterfree are coated with poisonous scales that easily fall off continuously as it flies. If inhaled, it results in several status conditions. Using this powder, it will defend Caterpie from bird Pok\u00e9mon. This powder also repels water, enabling it to fly and gather honey even in the rain. Butterfree can use its sensitive antenna to detect the odors of blooming flowers six miles (ten kilometers) from its nest in search of nectar, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes, it has territorial disputes with Cutiefly over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by Heracross , as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode A Sappy Ending . Butterfree is found in temperate forests and jungles , but it also observed in the episode Bye Bye Butterfree flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Butterfree is known to sleep while flapping its wings. It tends to accidentally scatter highly toxic dust while sleeping. [1]",

The combination of red and yellow in its color scheme creates a bright warning to predators that it is poisonous. Weedle has a conical, two-inch (five-centimeter) venomous stinger on its head and a barbed one on its tail. Weedle can retaliate against attackers and those who step on it with its strong toxin. It can distinguish its favorite kinds of leaves using its acute sense of smell. As a young Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon, its daily appetite for leaves matches its weight. Weedle can be found in temperate forests and usually hide in grass, bushes, and under the leaves they eat.",

It has two scythe-like arms in the middle of its body. When it comes close to evolving, its body gives off heat that makes it warm to the touch. Kakuna remains virtually immobile and waits for evolution, often hanging from tree branches by long strands of silk. When attacked, however, it can extend its poison barbs. Kakuna nests in temperate forests and misty wooded areas. Occasionally, it will also nest at the mouth of tunnels and caves, as seen in Pok\u00e9mon Snap .",

            "description": "Beedrill is an insect Pok\u00e9mon which mostly resembles a bipedal, yellow wasp; however, it only has four legs instead of six and lacks pigment pits . Beedrill's head is round with a slightly pointed mouth, large, red eyes, and black antennae with a sharp bend in the middle. Its forelegs are tipped with long, conical stingers. It stands on its other two legs, which are long, segmented, and insectoid in shape. Beedrill has two pairs of rounded, veined wings and another stinger on its yellow-and-black striped abdomen. The abdominal stinger contains Beedrill's most potent poison.\nBeedrill is highly territorial and unlike real bees, Beedrill live in colonies rather than true \"hives\", and they work together to solve basic problems regarding food, territory, and reproduction (a behavior more similar to that of wasps than of bees). As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Challenge of the Samurai , Beedrill seems to be especially concerned with the welfare of Weedle and Kakuna , responding aggressively to those that disturb them. Disturbing one Beedrill will cause the whole colony to attack. It flies at high speed and attacks using the large venomous stingers on its forelegs and abdomen. It will then take the victims of its attacks back to its nest for food. Beedrill nests in temperate forests and misty wooded areas. It is known to collect pollen, which Teddiursa combines with fruits to concoct honey . In the twelfth chapter of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , Beedrill is shown living in hives and producing honey. Prior to Generation V , Twineedle was its signature move .",

Just under its crest are its narrow eyes, which have white sclera and pupil and black irises. Angular black markings extend from behind its eyes and continue down its cheeks. It has a short, stubby beak and feet with two toes in front and one in back. Both its beak and feet are a grayish-pink. It has a short, brown tail made of three feathers.\nPidgey has an extremely sharp sense of direction and homing instincts. It can travel straight back to its nest regardless of how far away it might have flown. It is a docile Pok\u00e9mon and prefers to flee from its enemies rather than fight them. Flapping its wings rapidly can whip up dust clouds and create whirlwinds to protect itself and flush out potential prey. Pidgey is common throughout its range and can often be seen in meadows and temperate forests . Ekans and Sneasel are natural predators of Pidgey. Pidgey preys on Seedot .\nIn Generation III , Feather Dance was its signature move , though other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .",

Its glossy plumage is mostly brown with cream-colored underparts and flight feathers. Its head has a decorated crest nearly as long as its body. The center feathers of its crest are yellow, while the outer feathers are red. The fan-like feathers of its tail are red or brown. Its beak and legs are pink, with three forward-facing toes and one backward-facing toe on each foot. Behind each eye is an angular black marking.\nPidgeot's powerful wings can stir up windstorms in just a few flaps, and it may spread its wings to intimidate enemies. This Pok\u00e9mon is capable of flying faster than the speed of sound. Its plumage is often described as beautiful, making it a popular choice for skilled Trainers . Pidgeot typically dwells in temperate forests with thick growth and large trees. It is known to prey on Magikarp , which it can spot from great heights.\nIn Generation III , Feather Dance was its signature move , but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .",

Its most notable feature is its large teeth. Like most rodents, its teeth grow continuously throughout its life and must be worn down by gnawing. This also ensures that Rattata is not awoken by the sound of its grinding teeth while sleeping. Females will have shorter whiskers.\nRattata can live wherever it can find food, which it searches for most of the day. Thanks to its sharp fangs, it is able to chew on nearly anything. When it is threatened, Rattata can deliver a powerful bite. Rattata constantly keep their ears up and will immediately scurry away from the slightest sound. Furret is the natural predator of Rattata. Its hardiness lets it live in many environments, although it mainly lives on plains and savannas . Because it reproduces so quickly, a pair of Rattata can quickly colonize an area. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Rattata is known to sleep sometimes with a log in its mouth.

It has short arms with three-fingered hands and webbed feet with three toes. The webbing on its feet allows it to swim. Its tail is long and scaly. Females will have shorter whiskers.\nIf attacked, Raticate stands up on its hind legs, bares its fangs and shrieks in an intimidating manner at its enemy. It is willing to take on larger foes if provoked enough. Its teeth are strong enough to gnaw through steel and their constant growth means it often needs to gnaw on something, like rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses, and is capable of chewing through cinderblocks and toppling concrete buildings.

It has narrow, dark brown eyes with white pupils and a short, hooked beak that is light pink. The feathers covering its wings are pinkish-red with lighter tips, and it has a beige underside with two thin, horizontal stripes. Its light pink feet have two toes in front and one in the back. Black feathers cover its back.\nAlthough inept at other aspects of its flying, such as height and distance, Spearow is still capable of flying quickly to protect its territory. However, it must flap its wings at high speeds to stay aloft. Spearow's loud shrieks can be heard over half a mile (one kilometer) away, and are used to warn other of its kind of danger. In the first episode of Pok\u00e9mon the Series , Spearow is revealed to see in black and white and will chase its foes in a large flock. Spearow are found naturally in open habitats with warmer climates, mainly desolate wastelands and fields , where it hunts for insects. Ekans is a natural predator of Spearow. Spearow preys on Sunkern .",

It has a long, pointed, pink beak and a decorative red coxcomb on top of its head. Its narrow eyes have very small pupils and do not appear to have colored irises. It has shaggy feathers at the base of its neck and covering the upper portion of its wings. These feathers are cream-colored, as are the tips of its flight feathers. Its sharp-clawed talons are pink, with three toes pointing forward and one pointing backward.\nFearow has been around mostly unchanged for many years, as a Pok\u00e9mon resembling it has been seen on ancient murals. Its large wings and stamina allow it to fly for an entire day without landing. Its long neck and beak allow it to pluck prey from both land and water, and it has even been known to steal from unwary humans. It will shoot upward, and then dive down to catch prey. It will also catch tiny insects that hide underground and circle the ocean for fish. Fearow are found naturally in open habitats with warmer climates, mainly wastelands and desolate fields .",

Its large mouth has a round, pink tongue and no visible teeth. While painful, a newborn Ekans's bite is not venomous. This Pok\u00e9mon grows longer with age.\nEkans live in grassy savannas and plains , moving stealthily through the grass. It can also be found in forests and desolate wastelands, where it preys on Eggs from Pidgey and Spearow nests but will strike other prey from behind. By flicking its tongue out, it can detect danger and the scent of prey. Its jaw can detach to swallow large prey, but such a meal can make Ekans too heavy to move or become stuck and cause them to faint. It wraps itself around tree branches at night to rest. If not in a tree, it will coil itself up\u2014a position in which it can defend itself from all directions. In the second movie , it is revealed to possess some swimming abilities. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Ekans are known to sleep with their bodies all coiled up.

            "description": "Arbok is a serpentine Pok\u00e9mon that resembles a cobra . It has narrow eyes and several sharp teeth. Just below its head is a large hood with a face-like pattern. This pattern has over 20 possible variations. The pattern typically has two red and yellow eyespots outlined in black, a wide black streak resembling an upturned mouth, and a black V-shaped stripe above the eyespots.\nArbok is capable of crushing opponents by coiling its body around them and squeezing them tightly. It can even flatten steel oil drums. If it encounters an enemy, it raises its head, mimics, and stuns the opponent using the frightening pattern on its body. It can also make eerie sounds by expelling air from its mouth. It has been stated that if any part of Arbok's body except for the head is cut off, it can regrow the rest of its body again in a few weeks. It also can detect vibrations as shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Whistle Stop . The Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Misty Mermaid shows that Arbok can spend long periods underwater and survive in aquatic environments. One particular Arbok could change its pattern at any time to increase power to different stats and get invulnerability to status conditions , if the pattern is uncovered.\nArbok is territorial. It lashes out at intruders with long fangs tipped with deadly venom. Vengeful in nature, it will not give up a chase once it targets its prey or an opponent, no matter how far. It makes its home in grassy savannas and plains , but it can also be found in forests and desolate wastelands alongside its pre-evolved form Ekans . In the wild, it hunts smaller Pok\u00e9mon such as Wooper , and also preys on Pidgey and Spearow Eggs. When hunting, it uses the pattern on its hood to immobilize prey, then constricts them, and finally poisons the target to finish them off and eat them. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Arbok is known to display its belly while sleeping. It is theorized that Arbok does this to scare other Pok\u00e9mon away by showcasing its fearsome markings.\nBefore Generation II , Arbok and its pre-evolved form, Ekans, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Glare .",

            "description": "Pikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pok\u00e9mon . It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs; therefore, Pikachu is a facultative biped.\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Pikachu's Goodbye , wild Pikachu are shown to live in groups in forested areas . Pikachu communicate amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. In A Plethora of Pikachu! , it is shown that Alolan Pikachu are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as with other Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forage for Berries , which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. In The Electric Tale of Pikachu manga, it is depicted eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment. By occasion, it can get unintentionally swallowed by Cramorant . While startled, it looks for ways to escape from the latter.\nPikachu charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It can release electric discharges of varying intensity. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Sparks Fly for Magnemite , Pikachu is shown to build up energy in its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharge fellow Pikachu with electric shocks. Pikachu and its evolutionary relatives are related to Pachirisu . As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Pikachu is known to generate electricity through its cheeks while sleeping. Pikachu discharges while sleeping due to it dreaming of firing electric shots. [1]\nPikachu and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Volt Tackle . Pikachu is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move Catastropika , and the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Light Ball item.",

            "description": "Raichu is a bipedal, rodent -like Pok\u00e9mon . Raichu is covered in dark orange fur with a white belly. Its bifurcated ears are brown on the outside, yellow on the insides, and end in a distinctive curl. There is a circular yellow marking on each cheek where its electric sacs are, and it has a triangular, dark brown nose. Its arms and feet have patches of brown fur at the end, and the soles of its long feet are tan with a circular orange pad in the center. On its back are two horizontal brown stripes. Its long, thin tail has a lightning bolt-shaped end. This lightning bolt is chipped on females. Raichu exudes a weak electrical charge from its body and glows slightly in the dark.\nRaichu's tail is used to gather electricity from the atmosphere, or it can be planted in the ground to search for electricity. It also protects Raichu from its high-voltage power. Raichu can store over 100,000 volts of electricity, enough to knock out a Copperajah . If Raichu's sacs are fully charged, its ears will stand straight up, and its muscles will become stimulated. However, it will become aggressive if it has stored too much electricity and stress. To prevent it from reaching this state, it discharges electricity through its tail into the ground. This leads to scorched patches near its nest. Being the result of evolution via Evolution stone , Raichu is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in forests and woodlands . The main reason Raichu is rarely seen with Pok\u00e9mon trainers is because people prefer the look it had as Pikachu . As revealed in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Electric Shock Showdown , Raichu is not capable of learning speed attacks upon evolving and can only learn them when they're still Pikachu. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Raichu is known to sleep while discharging electricity, and a long tail is planted into the ground like a rod. It can electrocute anyone who comes near it while sleeping. [1]\nRaichu and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Volt Tackle .",

Its brick-patterned yellow hide is dry and tough, blends in with desert sand, and protects its soft white underbelly and muzzle. Sandshrew has blue, almond-shaped eyes, a pointed snout, and triangular ears with white insides. Its tail is thick and conical. It has two long claws on each foot and three sharp claws on its forepaws, which are used to burrow.\nSandshrew spends much of its time hidden underground in deep burrows. It only emerges to lunge and drag in passing Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon. Sandshrew can quickly curl into a tight ball to protect itself from great falls and opponents but may also throw sand at attackers. While its body can efficiently absorb water to facilitate life in the desert , Sandshrew has been found in caves as well. It also lives deep underground in nests it has created from digging tunnels. Should hard rocks get in the way of digging, Sandshrew will use its sharp claws to remove them before continuing to dig. If it is too wet, its skin becomes wrinkly. It dries itself out by using the geothermal heat near a volcano. It is also known to bathe in sand, which helps remove dirt and moisture from its body.",

Its back is mostly covered in sharp, brown quills from its tough, dry hide. It has two large claws on its paws and feet. These claws are its primary weapons and are used for slashing, but can also be used for burrowing. Its claws and spikes can both break off, but they grow back quickly and are shed regularly. Sandslash's broken parts can be used to carve plows for tilling farm fields. The claws can become harder and smoother if they live in drier areas.\nSandslash can curl into a large ball, which allows it to roll to attack or escape, protect itself from heatstroke, and guard its belly. Sandslash is also adept at climbing trees and is prone to ambush its enemies from above. It also climbs trees to rest during the night and to slash Berries to feed the Sandshrew waiting below.

It is light blue with several darker blue spots. There are two white claws on each of its paws. Its back is covered with small toxic spines, and it has a small forehead horn. The poisons secreted by the spines and horn are extremely potent, and even a scratch from its horn or a drop of poison from its barbs can be deadly. However, this docile Pok\u00e9mon only uses its poison when it feels threatened. Nidoran-f is more sensitive to smell than Nidoran-m. It can use its whiskers to check the wind while searching for berries or avoiding predators. Nidoran-f can use its incisor teeth to crush the berries it forages for. Nidoran-f lives in open spaces, such as savannas and plains. Nidoran-f is a female-only species.",

Its paws have three claws each, and it is able to stand on its hind legs. The hind legs are longer and thicker than its forelegs. It has a stubby tail. Nidorina is a female-only species.\nNidorina is a gentle Pok\u00e9mon, and it is known to be a caring mother that chews food for its young. It seems to display close family bonds with others of its kind and becomes nervous when separated. Nidorina prefers not to fight since its horn grows slowly, but if forced or enraged, it prefers physical attacks such as clawing and biting. Nidorina prefers to chew its food into a paste before spitting it out and feeding its children. It also emits ultrasonic cries to befuddle foes. Nidorina live in burrows at hot savannas and plains .",

It has a blunt snout, narrow brown eyes, and large ears with brown insides. There is a small horn on its forehead, a single spine on each ear, and a line of toxic spikes running down its back. Each hand has three short claws, and each foot has two claws. Its lower jaw, the front of its abdomen, and two plates on its chest are cream-colored. It has a thick, powerful tail. Nidoqueen is a female-only species.\nNidoqueen can be quite fierce and is very protective of its young. This Pok\u00e9mon is at its strongest when it is defending its young, and it will try to seal the entrance to its burrow to protect them. It also places its young in the gaps between the spines on its back, which never release poison when the children are present. Nidoqueen is more adept at being defensive than offensive. Nidoqueen's armor-like scales allow it to defend its children from any attack. When in contact with foes, it can poison them with the spikes on its back or cause small tremors by slamming the ground. It is also adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles, and it uses its hefty bulk to execute powerful moves. Being the result of an evolution via Evolution stone , Nidoqueen is rarely found in the wild. However, they can be found in savannas and plains .",

It has large, spiny ears with teal insides, oversized front teeth, and red eyes. Its back is covered with three lines of large spines that can release potent poisons if threatened. The center line of spines is taller than the other two. The size of the long, pointed horn on its forehead is indicative of the strength of its venom. Nidoran-m is a male-only species. Nidoran-m constantly listens for the sounds of approaching enemies with its large ears. Said ears have unique muscles that allow them to be moved in any direction, and even the slightest sound does not escape Nidoran-m's notice. In order to listen to distant locations, it flaps its ears like wings. When angry, it extends its toxic spikes and charges, stabbing with its horn to inject poison. Nidoran-m is brave, and will risk its own life to protect Nidoran-f. Nidoran-m lives in open spaces, such as savannas and plains.",

Nidorino has a ridge of toxic spines on its back and a long, pointed horn on its forehead. The horn is harder than a diamond and can secrete poison on impact. The more adrenaline Nidorino has in its body, the more potent the poison is. Its short legs have three claws on each foot. Nidorino is a male-only species.\nNidorino is independent, nervous, and fierce, often described as violent and easily angered. It uses its ears to check its surroundings. If it senses a hostile presence, all the barbs on its back bristle up at once, and it challenges the foe with all its might. Nidorino's harder-than-diamond horn can destroy diamonds, and it uses that horn to destroy boulders in its search for Moon Stones . Nidorino live in hot savannas and plains .",

It has narrow eyes, large, spiny ears, fur-like tufts on its cheeks, and a short snout filled with pointed teeth. A long, venomous horn is on its forehead and a ridge of spines down its back. Gray plates cover its chest and belly, with a gray, rounded spine on each elbow. Each hand has three claws, while each foot has only a single hoof-like nail. It has a long, powerful tail. Nidoking is a male-only species.\nIt is said that Nidoking's tail can topple a metal transmission tower. Nidoking uses this tail to smash, constrict, or break the bones of its prey and enemies. The tail can also be swung to create distance between it and its foes before Nidoking charges. Its steel-like hide adds to its powerful, rampaging charges. Nidoking's horn is powerful enough to crush diamonds. Nidoking is known to be very proud of its own strength. When Nidoking goes on a rampage, it becomes impossible to control. Only a Nidoqueen that it has lived with for a long time can calm it down from its rampages. As shown in the 21st chapter of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , Nidoking has strong acid within its claws. Being the result of evolution via an Evolution stone , Nidoking is rarely found in the wild. However, they can be found in savannas and plains .",

            "description": "Clefairy is a bipedal, pink Pok\u00e9mon with a chubby, vaguely star-shaped body. A small, pointed tooth protrudes from the upper left corner of its mouth. It has wrinkles beside its black, oval eyes, a single dark pink oval marking on each cheek, and large, pointed ears with brown tips. A tuft of fur curls over its forehead, much like its large, upward-curling tail. Each stocky arm has two small claws and a thumb on each hand, and both feet have a single toenail. There is a pair of tiny, butterfly-shaped wings on its back. Though incapable of flight, Clefairy's wings can store moonlight and allow it to float.\nClefairy is very shy and rarely shows itself to humans. On the rare occasions that Clefairy comes down from its mountain home , it can be seen dancing underneath the full moon's light. The area surrounding their dance is enveloped in a magnetic field. Once the sun rises, it returns home, where it sleeps nestled with other Clefairy. There have been many sightings of Clefairy during the morning aftermath of the full moon. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Clefairy Tales , Clefairy is depicted as an extraterrestrial Pok\u00e9mon . Clefairy is known to be popular thanks to both its adorable look and behavior. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , anyone who sees a Clefairy using Metronome while sleeping will receive happiness. This sighting is considered to be a very unusual sight to witness. [1]\nBefore Generation V , Clefairy and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Magic Guard as an Ability .",

A curled lock of fur hangs over its forehead, much like its long, tightly curled tail. On its back is a pair of dark pink wings; each wing has three points. Its hands have three fingers each, and its feet have two clawed toes and dark pink soles.\nClefable is a timid, nocturnal creature that flees when it senses people approaching and is one of the world's rarest Pok\u00e9mon. Its sensitive ears can distinctly hear a pin drop from half a mile to 1,100 yards away. Because of its acute hearing, it prefers to live in quiet, mountainous areas of which it is protective. It has also been seen at deserted lakes during a full moon. Using a bouncy gait, it can walk on water and sometimes appears to be flying using its small wings. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Clefairy Tales , Clefable is depicted as an extraterrestrial Pok\u00e9mon . According to one tradition, seeing a pair of Clefable ensures a happy marriage. Some scientists believe Clefable stares intently at the moon because it is homesick. There is also a legend to this, which tells of how it listens for the voices of its kind on the moon during clear and quiet nights. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Clefable is known to sleep in remote places during quiet, moonlit nights. It is theorized that Clefable is dreaming about its friends and distant homeland during its peaceful slumber .\nBefore Generation V , Clefable and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Magic Guard as an Ability .",

On top of its head are three curled locks of orange fur with bangs, and it has orange tails with curled tips. It is most commonly seen with six tails. However, Vulpix is born with only a white tail that splits as Vulpix grows . The tails grow hot as Vulpix approaches evolution.\nVulpix can manipulate fire to such precision as to create floating wisps of flame. These wisps are sometimes mistaken for ghosts by humans, but Vulpix uses them to assist in catching prey. Inside its body is a flame that never goes out. When the temperature outside increases, it will expel flames from its mouth to prevent its body from overheating. Vulpix performs this even when sleeping, as mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex . Vulpix is known to feign injury to escape from opponents too powerful for it to defeat. Vulpix is most commonly found in grassy plains .",

It has a small mane of thicker fur around its neck and a long, fluffy crest atop its head. It has slender legs with three-toed paws and nine long tails with pale orange tips. It has red eyes, pointed ears, and a triangular black nose.\nA legend claims that Ninetales is the reincarnation of 9 united noble saints. While intelligent enough to easily understand human speech, Ninetales is a vengeful Pok\u00e9mon known to curse those who mistreat it. Ninetales will also curse anyone who wakes it up by grabbing one of its many tails. The curse can last up to 1,000 years. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team , once a Ninetales casts its curse, it cannot be removed even by Ninetales itself. It can live for 1,000 years due to the energy within its nine tails, each of which is said to have a different mystical power. Flames spewed from its mouth can hypnotize an opponent and its gleaming red eyes are said to give it the ability to control minds. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Ninetales is known to sleep while wrapped inside its tails, giving it a mystical appearance. In the first Pok\u00e9mon movie , it's shown that it can swim. Pok\u00e9mon-Amie shows that Ninetales lick their paws to clean themselves. Being the result of an Evolution via Evolution stone , Ninetales are rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in grasslands .",

            "description": "Jigglypuff is a pink Pok\u00e9mon with a spherical body. It has pointed ears with black insides and large, blue eyes. It has small, stubby arms and slightly longer feet. On top of its head is a curled tuft of fur. Its body is filled with air and, as seen in Pok\u00e9mon Stadium , Jigglypuff can deflate until it is flat. It can float by drawing extra air into its body, as demonstrated in Super Smash Bros.\nJigglypuff can use its eyes to mesmerize opponents. It has a large lung capacity, exceeding most other Pok\u00e9mon. Once it has an opponent's attention, Jigglypuff will inflate its lungs and begin to sing a soothing and mysterious lullaby. This melody can cause anyone who listens to become sleepy. If the opponent resists falling asleep, Jigglypuff will endanger its own life by continuing to sing until it runs out of air. It will continue to sing until the opponent is asleep. It can adjust the wavelength of its voice to match the brain waves of someone in a deep sleep. This helps ensure drowsiness in its opponents. Its vocal range exceeds 12 octaves, but its skill depends on the individual. Its song varies by region, and in some areas, it sounds like shouting. Jigglypuff can mostly be found in lush green plains and grassy meadows . Scream Tail shares a resemblance to Jigglypuff. It is believed Scream Tail is Jigglypuff's ancestor from 1,000,000,000 years ago. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Jigglypuff is known to sing even when sleeping. [1]",

            "description": "Wigglytuff is a balloon -like Pok\u00e9mon with leporine features, a bean-shaped body and stubby arms and legs. There is a fluffy, curled tuft of fur on its head, which is described as perfectly heavenly. It has long, rabbit-like ears with black insides and a slightly lighter color at the tips. Its large, blue eyes are covered in a layer of tears that quickly washes away any debris. It is covered in pink fur with a white belly. This fine layer of fur is so soft that those who touch it, including other Wigglytuff, will not want to stop. As a result, Wigglytuff is a highly sought-after Pok\u00e9mon because of its bouncy body and fur. It sheds seasonally, and people gather the fur to spin into yarn. It is proud of its fine and delicate fur.\nIts body is soft and rubbery, allowing it to inflate by inhaling. Wigglytuff can inflate itself up to 20 times larger, though it has no limits to how far it can inflate in total. While it is inflated, it can move by bouncing or floating. It competes with other Wigglytuff to see which one can inflate itself the most. Should it be caught in a bad mood, Wigglytuff will inflate itself to an enormous size to scare away its opponent. Being the result of evolution via Evolution stone , Wigglytuff is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in vivid green plains and grassy fields . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Wigglytuff is known to stroke its belly while sleeping, possibly to feel its soft fur .",

A male will have larger fangs than a female. It has purple wing membranes supported by two, elongated fingers, and two long, thin tails.\nZubat lives in abundance in dark caves , although it has also been known to dwell in forests and under the eaves of old buildings. Due to its habitat, Zubat has evolved to have neither eyes nor nostrils. It instead navigates through dark environments and tight caves with echolocation , emitting ultrasonic cries to detect targets and obstacles. The frequency of these cries can vary slightly between Zubat colonies. As demonstrated in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Clefairy and the Moon Stone , it will leave its abode at night with a mass of other Zubat in order to seek prey. Zubat is nocturnal, and sleeps hanging upside down during the daytime, avoiding sunlight at all costs. Daylight causes Zubat to become unhealthy, and prolonged exposure can even burn its skin. However, captured and trained Zubat have been recorded as being much more tenacious in the daytime, even when directly exposed to sunbeams. While sleeping, or in colder conditions, Zubat gathers with others of its kind for warmth.",

            "description": "Golbat is a large, blue, chiropteran Pok\u00e9mon with purple wing membranes. It has small eyes with slit-like pupils, along with tiny triangular ears with purple insides, and a massive mouth with two fangs in each jaw. The fangs are smaller on a female Golbat. While its mouth seems to be otherwise empty, Golbat occasionally displays a long, purple tongue. It has short legs with long, tiny feet. Despite this, Golbat can walk skillfully on the ground.\nGolbat's fangs have hollow tubes (similar to straws) specialized for sucking blood. While they are strong enough to pierce thick hide, they are also unexpectedly fragile. There are some Golbat that have missing fangs as a result of their hunger-fueled attempt to try drinking blood from Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon. Golbat feeds on the blood of both Pok\u00e9mon and humans and is capable of drinking over 10 ounces (300 milliliters) of blood in one sitting. It is gluttonous, and drinks so much blood that its blood type will change to that of its victim following a feed. It occasionally gorges itself to the extent that it becomes too heavy to fly, leaving itself vulnerable in turn. However, it is also willing to share gathered blood with other members of its kind that are hungry. One particular Golbat could utilize Supersonic to produce a magic mirror in its mouth for scrying to see things from a distance, even if walls or land are in the way. Golbat is nocturnal and can be found quite easily in caves .",

Five large, green leaves sprout from its head. As demonstrated in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Foul Weather Friends , these leaves are prehensile and can be used to scale vertical surfaces and catch light objects. Known by the scientific name Oddium Wanderus , Oddish lives in grasslands .\nA nocturnal Pok\u00e9mon, Oddish buries its sensitive body in the ground during the day to avoid the sun and fool predators. If its leaves are pulled in this state, it will respond by shrieking horribly. It starts to move when its leaves begin absorbing moonlight, which it uses to grow. Oddish will wander up to 1,000 feet (300 meters) during the night to scatter its seeds and find a nutrient-rich patch of soil in which to plant itself. The more fertile the earth, the glossier its leaves will be. It is thought that its feet become like tree roots while planted. In Generation I , Petal Dance was its signature move .",

Gloom's eyes are wide and often appear closed and its lips are thin and purple.\nGloom trickles sticky nectar from its mouth with the appearance and consistency of drool. This can be used as a fertilizer for plants. Both this nectar and the flower on Gloom's head release a foul odor strong enough to induce fainting in humans over a mile (1.6 kilometers) away. However, it can also attract prey, and even a very small number of humans find it pleasing. This odor is a key ingredient for some perfume production. When it is in danger, the odor worsens, but it will not emit its odor if it feels safe. Gloom lives in grassy plains . In Generation I , Petal Dance was its signature move .",

            "description": "Vileplume is an indigo, bipedal Rafflesia -like Pok\u00e9mon with rudimentary hands and feet. It has beady red eyes and a small mouth, and its head and torso are a single joined segment. On its head is a massive red flower with five bulky petals and an orange-brown center. Vileplume's flower is said to have the largest petals in the world and is almost too heavy for the Pok\u00e9mon itself to support. The rounded petals of the flower are red and covered with white spots. A female Vileplume has fewer, but larger, spots on its petals. When defeated in the side series games, Vileplume's body appears to either deflate or withers while the flower remains.\nVileplume can shake, flap, or burst its petals into bloom with a bang in order to release clouds of pollen. This pollen is yellow and highly allergenic to humans, and toxic to other Pok\u00e9mon; Vileplume uses it to paralyze its prey before devouring it. The larger the Vileplume's petals are, the more potent the toxin on its pollen is. Vileplume's behavior of flapping its petals also makes very loud noises. In Generation I , Petal Dance was its signature move . Being the result of an Evolution via Evolution stone , Vileplume is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in grassy plains . It is often mistaken for local flowers in the wild.",

It has circular eyes with large pseudopupils.\nRed-and-yellow mushrooms known as tochukaso grow on this Pok\u00e9mon's back. The mushrooms can be removed at any time and grow from spores that are doused on this Pok\u00e9mon's back at birth by the mushroom on its mother's back. Tochukaso are parasitic in nature, drawing their nutrients from the host Paras's body in order to grow and exerting some command over the Pok\u00e9mon's actions. For example, Paras drains nutrients from tree roots due to commands from the mushrooms. The mushrooms are also popular among collectors and have medicinal uses, usually involving extended life. Prior to Generation III , Spore was its signature move .\nParas can often be found in caves ; however, it can also thrive in damp forests . In the Alola region , the mushrooms on its back do not grow well. This is thought to be from a lack of moisture or nutrients.",

            "description": "Venomoth is a lepidopteran insect Pok\u00e9mon whose body is varying shades of purple. Its head and thorax are both light purple, and it has bulbous, round, light blue eyes, a small mandible, and a three-point crest on its head. Tucked close to its thorax are three pairs of tiny, whitish legs. Its abdomen is paler with several black, zigzagging stripes encircling it. It has two pairs of pale purple moth-like wings with thin black venation . Its official artwork and various TCG cards depict the wings as translucent. [1]\nVenomoth's wings are covered in dust-like scales that vary in color depending on their toxic capability. Dark scales are poisonous, while lighter scales can cause paralysis. These scales are released when Venomoth flutters its wings and leak out poison once they make contact with the skin. Venomoth lives in dense temperate forests with thick undergrowth and little light. As a nocturnal Pok\u00e9mon, Venomoth comes out at night to hunt for its favorite prey. It prefers to feed on insects that gather around light sources, and Venomoth is attracted to bright lights itself. As stated in the third chapter of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , Venomoth has a short lifespan.",

Its small stature makes it both the lightest and shortest Ground type. It has beady black eyes and a large, round, pink nose. A Diglett in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team mentions that it has feet, though their size and appearance are unknown. It spends much of its time underground and has very thin skin. If Diglett is exposed to sunlight, its blood will heat up and cause it to grow weak.\nDiglett lives in tunnels and caves under the earth, where it feeds on tree roots and vegetables. It is known to live in burrows left behind by Onix . It also sometimes lives in burrows near forests and has even been shown to live inside of trees. Diglett digs regularly through the earth at a shallow depth, leaving perfectly tilled soil in its wake. Some farmers welcome Diglett because it tills their fields and its droppings enrich the soil, but others consider it a pest for eating their vegetables. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Diglett is known to sleep underground during the night. Seeing a Diglett asleep above ground is considered to be good luck. [1]\nIn Generation II , Diglett and its evolved form, Dugtrio , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Fissure .",

Each head is incredibly tough with a smooth surface, and has brown skin, black eyes, and a large, round, pink nose. Dugtrio's three heads think the same thoughts and act cooperatively, though on rare occasions may fight over which head gets to eat first. In order to make burrowing easier, each head will bob up and down to loosen the soil. Dugtrio can tunnel under the earth at 60\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) to a depth of 60 miles (100 kilometers), triggering tremors and earthquakes. It is capable of burrowing endlessly. Dugtrio lives in tunnels and caves under the earth. Dugtrio is considered important for agriculture as its digging aerates the soil and makes it suitable for farming. As shown in the Pikachu short Pikachu's Rescue Adventure , Dugtrio sometimes lives in hollow trees in forests. It maintains the soil and plants trees to revitalize wooded areas. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , the three triplets of Dugtrio is known to sleep together, never separating from each other. The trio's teamwork remains strong even when sleeping.

Its ovoid head features four prominent whiskers, wide eyes with slit pupils, two pointed teeth in the upper jaw, and a gold koban coin embedded in its forehead. Its ears are black with brown interiors and are flanked with an additional pair of long whiskers. Meowth is a quadruped with the ability to walk on its hind legs; while the games almost always depict Meowth on two legs, it is stated in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Go West Young Meowth that Meowth normally walks on all fours. It can freely manipulate its claws, retracting them when it wants to move silently. The tip of its tail curls tightly.\nMeowth is attracted to round and shiny objects and has the unique ability to produce coins using its signature move , Pay Day . Meowth and its evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Pay Day by leveling up. Being nocturnal, it is known to wander about city streets at night and pick up anything that sparkles, including loose change. Upon finding a sparkling object, its eyes will glitter and the coin on its forehead will shine brightly. It shares this intrigue with Murkrow , with whom it often fights with for objects and prey. Meowth is a playful but fickle Pok\u00e9mon with the capacity for human-like intelligence, with at least one member of the species teaching itself how to speak. Meowth tends to live in urban areas . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Meowth is known to sleep with the coins it collects. [1]",

            "description": "Persian is a large, quadrupedal, feline Pok\u00e9mon . Its fur is pale tan with the exception of its black-rimmed ears. It has a short muzzle with a small, black nose, red eyes with slit pupils, rounded ears, a pair of pointed teeth in its upper jaw, and three whiskers on either side of its face. Its thick whiskers are very sensitive to changes in air movements, enabling it to detect its prey by movement alone. In the center of its forehead is a red jewel. Its long tail has a distinctive curl at the end. Persian communicates with body language and holds its tail upright to signal its intention to pounce. It has long legs and three-toed paws with retractable claws. Persian's lithe muscles also enable it to walk without making a sound.\nPersian normally lives in towns and cities . Although popular for its elegance, it is extremely difficult to raise as a pet due to its fickle and temperamental personality. It will scratch anyone, including its Trainer, with little or no provocation, and has been observed ripping its prey apart for no discernible reason. However, when Persian is yanked by its whiskers, it becomes temporarily docile for unknown reasons. It is popular among rich people and is targeted by hunters for its jewel. Its relationship with Perrserker is one of mutual disdain, as Persian's refined and elegant personality clashes with Perrserker's barbaric nature. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Persian is known to clean and groom itself even when asleep. Even when asleep, Persian maintains its striking and haughty expression.\nPersian and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Pay Day by leveling up.",

Its legs and tail are stubby, and it has cream-colored webbed feet. There are three claws on each of its hands.\nPsyduck is constantly stunned by its headache and is unable to think very clearly. It usually stands immobile, trying to calm its headache. However, when its headache becomes too severe, Psyduck releases tension in the form of strong psychic powers. The use of these powers produces brain waves identical to those seen in sleepers, and the Pok\u00e9mon is unable to recall these episodes. Psyduck lives in freshwater lakes and small ponds, but can be seen in rivers in tropical areas as shown in Pok\u00e9mon Snap . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Psyduck suffers headaches while it sleeps. Very rarely, their sights are Psyduck sleeping peacefully while not holding its head.\nPrior to Generation V , Psyduck and its evolved form, Golduck , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Cloud Nine as an Ability .",

It has red eyes, a cream-colored beak, a red gem in the center of its forehead, and four spikes on the back of its head. Its hands and feet all have three clawed digits with cream-colored webbing in between. Its body is specially adapted to have a hydrodynamic shape, and it has a long tail that it uses as a rudder to steer. Golduck is sometimes mistaken for the Japanese monster, and the physical inspiration for Golduck, the Kappa due to its general humanoid shape, beak, and webbed hands and feet.\nGolduck is a fast swimmer, capable of out-swimming even the most athletic of humans because of its webbed appendages. Even rough seas do not hamper this Pok\u00e9mon's swimming abilities, and it will sometimes rescue people from shipwrecks. The TCG depicts Golduck with the ability to shoot massive jets of water form both of its hands simultaneously, using them to propel itself underwater. The gem on its forehead glows when it uses its psychic powers, and occasionally when it swims at full speed. In the past, this Pok\u00e9mon was overhunted due to the belief that the gem granted people supernatural powers. As seen in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , Golduck has the ability to give knowledge to its Trainer and fellow Pok\u00e9mon through telepathy. Golduck can typically be seen swimming in lakes , where it hunts fish. The prey is disabled, captured, and then brought to shore for consumption. Old tales claim Golduck punishes those who defile their rivers by dragging them in and taking them away. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Golduck is known to paddle its webbed limbs while sleeping. It is believed Golduck is dreaming about swimming.\nPrior to Generation V , Golduck and its pre-evolved form, Psyduck , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Cloud Nine as an Ability .",

            "description": "Mankey is a small, simian Pok\u00e9mon , similar to a New World monkey . It is bipedal and has a round body covered in whitish, shaggy fur. Its nose is similar to a pig's snout, and it has narrow, red eyes and triangular ears with brown insides. Mankey's three-fingered hands, two-toed feet, and the tip of its curved, prehensile tail are brown.\nMankey specializes in physical fighting and is very aggressive and short-tempered. When angry, it begins shaking and its breathing turns rough. Its rage peaks quickly, preventing its victim from being able to flee. It will rampage until it falls asleep, but its anger remains in its dreams. This causes it to wake up and become furious all over again. However, this constant release of stress grants it a long life. Mankey can be found in the mountains , where it lives in treetop colonies. If one becomes enraged, the whole colony rampages for no reason. If it loses sight of its colony or if it is left alone to rage, its loneliness causes it to become infuriated.\nAccording to the Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team games, Mankey's preferred food is chestnuts . However, Mankey usually lacks the dexterity to peel them. It becomes agitated and rage after attempting to peel a chestnut's spiky shell. Additionally, it also appears to be fond of bananas, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Showdown at the Po-k\u00e9 Corral . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , it is rare to find a Mankey sleeping without an angry look on its face. [1]",

            "description": "Primeape is a bipedal, simian Pok\u00e9mon with a round body covered in light beige, shaggy fur. There is usually a throbbing vein on the left side of its forehead, and it has triangular ears with pink insides, narrow eyes with tiny pupils, and a pink, snout-like nose. Its arms and legs are brown and have metal shackles on the wrists and ankles. This is probably indicative of a method of training with weights. The hands have no visible fingers, instead resembling mittens or boxing gloves, and the feet have two toes.\nPrimeape is easily angered; even the slightest glance of eye contact will make it furious. When it becomes enraged, its blood circulation is boosted. This makes its muscles stronger, but at the cost of some of its intelligence. Primeape also possesses the ability to convert its anger into energy to attack its opponents with. It has sturdy vessels in its brain that keep it healthy despite its constant anger. It will chase anyone who upsets it and will not stop until it has caught up to its target. Even if it is awoken from sleep, it will groggily chase whatever woke it. Some researchers have a theory Primeape is angry even when inside a Pok\u00e9 Ball . In some cases, Primeape has been known to die as a result of its rage, though it is also said to look peaceful in death, potentially due to its rage transcending and leaving its physical form to become something new . In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Showdown at the Po-k\u00e9 Corra , it is shown to have a fondness for bananas. Primeape can be found on mountains. It competes with Ursaring when it comes to searching for berries. In Paldea , Hawlucha is Primeape's natural enemy. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , it is very rare to find a Primeape sleeping without rage, possibly from exhausting itself. [1]\nPrimeape and its evolved form, Annihilape , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Rage Fist .",

The fur on its muzzle, chest, belly, and tail is beige, as is an additional tuft of fur on top of its head. Growlithe's coat is noticeably longer on its chest and tail. It has gray eyes, a black nose, and large, round and triangular ears with beige interiors. Its forepaws have two visible claws, while its hind paws have three toes each. Each paw has a brown pad.\nGrowlithe is a friendly and loyal Pok\u00e9mon that will fearlessly defend its Trainer and territory from harm, even against larger, stronger enemies. In particular, it has been known to fight with Rockruff over territory. It will fiercely bark at, bite, and chase away any perceived threat. Otherwise, this obedient Pok\u00e9mon will wait motionlessly until given an order. It has a long history with people, as its bones have been found in Stone Age ruins. In the wild, Growlithe can be commonly found in grassy plains .\nGrowlithe also has a powerful olfactory sense. If it detects an unknown smell in its territory, it roars to flush out the intruder. It can smell the emotions of others, and never forgets a scent. However, strong, unpleasant smells can disable Growlithe's sense of smell for short periods, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Case of the K-9 Caper! . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Growlithe is known to bark at anyone who approaches it while sleeping. [1]",

It has diamond-shaped ears with beige insides, black eyes, a round, black nose, and two pointed teeth protruding from its upper jaw. Its head, muzzle, and chest are covered in shaggy, beige fur, except for two oval sections around each eye and ear. Long tufts of fur grow behind its elbows and around its ankles. Its underside is black, and it has a billowing, beige tail that is bent in the middle. Each paw has three toes and a round, pink pad.\nArcanine is a fiercely brave and loyal Pok\u00e9mon. It is capable of running 6,200 miles in 24 hours with a speed and grace reminiscent of flight. In Generation II , Extreme Speed was its signature move . Arcanine has long been admired for its beauty and speed, and anyone who hears its bark will grovel before it. The source of its power is a flame blazing wildly inside its body. Being the result of an evolution via Evolution stone , Arcanine is rarely found in the wild, but when found, it is usually seen living in prairies , and Pok\u00e9mon Snap has also shown it living in active volcanoes. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode On Cloud Arcanine , it was shown that it stashes food in its mane and carries it to its nest for its young. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Arcanine is known to sleep at supremely comfortable sleeping spot. Arcanine when it sleeps is said to be similar to how an innocent child sleeps.\nIn some locations, such as China , Arcanine is seen as a Legendary Pok\u00e9mon , where it's revered for its speed and power; it is also categorized as Legendary in An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS .",

            "description": "Poliwag is an amphibian Pok\u00e9mon resembling a blue, spherical tadpole . It has large eyes and pink lips that can also act as suction cups for rocks. Its skin is very thin, but flexible and difficult to puncture. There is a black and white swirl on its abdomen, which is actually its internal organs showing through its semitransparent skin. The swirl is clearer following a meal and will have a white tinge if the Pok\u00e9mon is affected by disease. The direction of the belly spiral differs by area; the equator is thought to have an effect on it.\nPoliwag has newly developed legs that are poor at walking and no arms. It has a long, thin tail surrounded by a light-blue, semitransparent fin. Its tail makes it a powerful swimmer. It loves to waddle on land despite the dangers. However, it will quickly return back into the water should it see danger. It cannot walk on land well unless trained everyday.\nBecause of its ineptitude on land, Poliwag is more likely to be found swimming in small freshwater ponds and lakes . In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Stun Spore Detour , Poliwag is shown feeding on salveyo weed , which can only be found on clear lake bottoms.",

A black and white swirl covers its belly, which is actually its organs showing through its thin skin. It appears to have white gloves on its hands and rounded, digit-less feet. When out of water, it sweats to keep its skin moist and healthy. This keeps it covered in an oily fluid that allows it to slip away from enemies. All of its skin feels this way except where its swirl is, which is instead very smooth. The swirl on its belly undulates slowly and staring at it induces drowsiness.\nEven though Poliwhirl is capable of moving on land, it prefers to stay in freshwater ponds and lakes where it has fewer natural enemies. It feeds on both bug and fish Pok\u00e9mon. While it will leave the water to capture bug Pok\u00e9mon, it will return and consume them underwater in safety. Its swirl is used to make children fall asleep. Poliwhirl's sweat is filled with slimy mucus. When captured by an enemy, it either slithers to escape or use its swirl to put the enemy to sleep.",

There appear to be white gloves on its hands, and it has rounded, digit-less feet.\nPoliwrath's body is almost entirely muscle, and the muscles in its arms and legs never tire. It also has zero percent body-fat. When it swims, it uses all of the muscles in its body and is able to swim vast distances with minimal breathing. It is even capable of briefly running on the water's surface. It can also smash through ice and plow forward using its strong arms. Poliwrath is capable of out-swimming even world-class swimmers. Poliwrath is also skilled at martial arts. It can launch powerful square punches capable of crushing boulders into dust. Many children learn how to swim by replicating Poliwrath's movement. It is one of the most gifted swimmers of all Water-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nBeing the result of an evolution via Evolution stone , Poliwrath is rarely found in the wild. When found, it is usually seen living on dry land near the water's edge , despite it being an excellent swimmer. In Alola , Poliwrath found are strong enough to use the breaststroke while swimming.",

            "description": "Abra is a bipedal mammalian Pok\u00e9mon that is primarily yellow. Its face is kite-shaped with a small, pale yellow snout and two short, pointed ears with pale yellow interiors. Its wide eyes are normally closed. Abra's body is segmented with black skin is visible between its joints and along its neck. It has two brown, pauldron -shaped extensions on its shoulders, as well as a brown, fauld -like piece around its chest. It has three digits on each hand and foot, but its fingers considerably shorter than its toes. Two of its toes face forward and one faces backward. Its tail is thick and long, with a brown band located near the tip.\nAbra can sense danger through a telepathic radar. When it does, it teleports to a safe location. However, it sometimes becomes panicked if it wakes in an unknown location. By hypnotizing itself, Abra is able to teleport itself even while sleeping. It can use other extrasensory abilities while sleeping as well and can even teleport into the treetops to pick and eat berries. The deeper Abra sleeps, the farther it teleports. Due to the strain of its telepathic powers, however, Abra sleeps 18 hours each day. If it fails to rest long enough, it will become unable to use its powers. The contents in Abra's dream can affect its powers. Abra lives in urban areas , but has been observed to teleport to a different location once per hour. If it teleports randomly, it can create illusory copies.",

It has two long, pointed ears on top of its head, a red star on its forehead, narrow, deep-set eyes, and wide cheeks leading down to a thin snout. Extending from each side of its snout are two mustache-like tufts of fur; a male will have a longer mustache than a female. Kadabra's torso is segmented with bulky shoulders, a thick, brown chest, and a small abdomen marked by three red, wavy lines. Attached to the Pok\u00e9mon's abdomen is a large, thick tail encircled with a brown band near its base. Its arms are thin with brown elbows and end in three-fingered hands with white claws. Its legs have prominent knees and large, three-toed feet, also ending in white claws. Two of its toes face forward and one backward. Kadabra is always seen carrying a silver spoon, which amplifies its telekinetic powers. A gold spoon does not work as an amplifier and Kadabra is only half as strong without a spoon.\nKadabra emits alpha waves strong enough to induce headaches, and can even cause clocks to run backward, machines to malfunction, and delicate devices to cease functioning altogether. The waves increase further in strength the more danger Kadabra faces. By closing its eyes, it can double the number of alpha particles it emits. When it has a headache, the alpha waves become unusual. All of Kadabra's brain cells work in unison while it uses its powers. It sleeps while levitating, using its springy tail like a pillow. It can store up psychic energy inside its star in preparation for its evolution. There is a theory that Kadabra was born from a transformed human child who could not control his powers. Kadabra lives in urban areas .\nKadabra and its evolved form, Alakazam , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Kinesis .",

The overflow of its psychic powers can cause headaches to those nearby. These powers are used to move its body, as opposed to its weak muscles. It also uses its psychic powers to hold up its head, which is too heavy to be supported by its neck. Due to its continually growing brain, its head becomes larger with age. It is said to have an excellent memory and can remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra , to the time of its death, and has an IQ that exceeds 5,000.

Machop also has a short, stubby tail.\nMachop's entire body is covered with muscles that will never tire or cramp. With these muscles, it can lift many times its own body weight; it is even capable of hurling up to 100 adults. It spends its time and energy working out and practicing all different forms of martial arts, striving to improve its abilities. One of its daily training routines involves lifting boulders and Graveler repeatedly as if they were barbells. It becomes more dedicated the more its muscles grow. Once it feels confident, it challenges Makuhita to a battle. Machop lives in the mountains , and its diet includes highly nutritious food that allows it to efficiently build up its muscles. In Generation II , Vital Throw was its signature move .",

It has a vaguely reptilian face with a short snout, narrow red eyes, and four pointed teeth visible inside its mouth. Two of these teeth are in the upper jaw, while two are in the lower jaw. On top of its head are three brown ridges. Its arms are muscular with dark red, vertical stripes on them. The lower part of its body has black markings that resemble briefs. It is always seen wearing a black and gold power-save belt resembling a championship belt . It possesses large pectoral muscles that protrude slightly over its belt.\nMachoke is a Pok\u00e9mon of immense strength. Its muscles are as hard as steel, and it is capable of lifting extremely heavy objects with only one finger. Machoke's body is powerful enough to never get tired. Machoke is a popular Pok\u00e9mon used as a motif for sculptures. In spite of this, it is modest and often helps people with manual labor. The belt it wears regulates its strength, but Machoke removes it when facing a truly powerful opponent. It can be found in the mountains , where it trains daily. In Generation II , Vital Throw was its signature move .",

On its head, there are three brown ridges right above its eyes. It has two arms on each side of its body: a pair located in the normal position, and another pair directly above that attaches on the top of the shoulders. It has black markings that resemble briefs and wears a golden power-save belt that resembles a championship belt . Its legs have considerable muscle tone, and its feet have two toes each.\nMachamp are said to know every martial arts style in the world. It punches extremely quickly, throwing 500 punches a second. With only one hand, it can move a mountain. In Generation VII , Strength was its signature move. Because of its four arms, it can hit from a multitude of angles and pin all of its foe's limbs down at once. Its arms also allow it to attack and defend simultaneously. The four arms react much faster than Machamp can think. However, it has poor dexterity, and cannot handle delicate work without its arms becoming tangled. The belt it wears restricts its muscle activity, but it can cause consequences if removed. Being the result of an evolution via trading , Machamp is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in the mountains . In Alola , Machamp is used as a Ride Pok\u00e9mon called Machamp Shove, where Marchamp carries humans on its arms while moving large rocks out fo the way.\nIn Generation II , Vital Throw was its signature move .",

It has a yellow bell-shaped head with what appear to be pink lips at the end and beady black eyes. It is capable of spitting corrosive acid from its mouth. Its stem is long, thin and very flexible, making it capable of swerving rapidly to avoid many attacks or moving with blinding speed to capture prey. Its roots resemble feet, and it uses them as such.\nIt will plant its roots in the ground to replenish water, but it is unable to flee while it is rooted. Bellsprout prefers hot and humid places, thus it lives in temperate forests and jungles . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Bellsprout is known to sleep while planting its roots deep in the ground. Because Bellsprout feels so safe while sleeping, it tends to forget that it may need to run from danger.",

Above Weepinbell's circular eyes are three small green spots and a small, brown hook-shaped stem. It has wide, gaping mouth with pink lips. On each side of its body is a large, green leaf.\nWeepinbell camouflages itself as a plant in the forest whilst awaiting an unwary victim. When its prey draws near it sprays poison powder to immobilize the target before melting it with its internal acids. It oozes a neutralizing fluid that prevents these internal acids from melting its own body. It will also slice its prey too large to consume into pieces with its razor-sharp leaves. Weepinbell live in temperate forests and jungles where it hangs from tree branches by its stem to sleep. If it moves around during sleep, Weepinbell may slip and awaken to find itself on the ground. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Weepinbell is known to sometimes sleep undisturbed, even after falling down to the ground . [1]",

Its semicircular eyes appear directly under its mouth and it has several dark green spots on its body. On either side of its body is a large green leaf. Covering Victreebel's mouth is a leaf with a long, brown, yellow-tipped vine growing out of it. The vine is flicked to mimic an animal in order to attract prey. Victreebel also produces a sweet scent to further aid in luring its victims. Acid that has dissolved numerous prey animals becomes sweeter and even more effective at attracting prey.\nIt can be found in small groups and is territorial. In the 22nd chapter of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , Victreebel hoards food, usually small birds and rodents, and collects Leaf Stones to perform Evolution rituals at night to help Weepinbell become more Victreebel. Being the result of exposure to an Evolution stone , Victreebel is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in temperate forests and jungles . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Victreebel is known to sleep with its mouth open to draw in prey. Very rarely, it forgets about luring in prey and instead chooses to sleep face down.",

There are two grayish tentacles extending from beneath its round lower body, which has a cape-like formation on the back.\nTentacool's entire body is made of 99% water, and the remaining 1% contains the organ that produces its poison. It absorbs sunlight and refracts it using the water inside its body to convert it into beam energy. Its tentacles are laced with stinging cells and, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Tentacool & Tentacruel , it can control Pok\u00e9mon it touches with its tentacles. The tentacles break off occasionally, but they can regenerate. The poison from its tentacles is so potent, that someone would need to be immediately rushed to the hospital. Tentacool is not a very strong swimmer, traveling throughout the world using ocean currents. Tentacool searches for food while drifting on the surface of shallow seas. Tentacool can blend in the water, making it very difficult to spot. It will sometimes wash ashore and shrivel up due to dehydration, though it remains equally as dangerous. Tentacool may be revived if thrown back into the sea.\nTentacool is mistakenly believed to be a species relative of Toedscool ; in actuality, the two Pok\u00e9mon are biologically unrelated.",

Its red orbs glow whenever it is excited or agitated, communicating with its own kind, and it may alert others to danger by stridently flashing them. They are also capable of refracting sunlight, storing energy, and firing ultrasonic waves.\nTentacruel's primarily light blue body helps it camouflage in the water. It has a total of 80 tentacles, which it can readily extend during hunts to ensnare its prey in a net-like shape before immobilizing it with poison. The tentacles can grow or shrink with ease. Its tentacles can absorb water to stretch even further. Most of these tentacles are hidden and kept short, leaving up to 14 exposed. However, it tends to lose tentacles as it ages. While Tentacruel are rarely seen, they can gather in large groups which scares away any nearby fish Pok\u00e9mon. Tentacruel lives in underwater rock formations and can be found throughout the ocean .\nAlthough Toedscruel bears a strong resemblance to Tentacruel, the two species are biologically unrelated.",

Its arms are muscular with five-fingered hands. Geodude uses its arms to climb steadily up steep mountain paths. As a result of their physical appearance, Rhyperior sometimes mistake this Pok\u00e9mon for actual boulders and fire them through their hands.\nGeodude is proud of its sturdy body and will bash against others of its kind in a contest of sorts to prove whose body is harder. It will even go as far as to compare itself with other species such as Roggenrola and Carbink . The longer it lives, the more chipped and worn its body becomes. Long-lived Geodude are completely smooth and round and they have a calm demeanor. However, Geodude's heart remains rugged and tough, no matter what. Geodude can be most often found on mountain trails and fields , with a scholar counting about 100 of them on just one route. It will sit still in these areas, which is why it is often mistaken for a rock. It is often stepped on and will sometimes swing its arms in anger when this occurs. When Geodude sleeps deeply, it buries itself halfway into the ground. Once buried, it will not awaken even if someone steps on it. In the morning, Geodude rolls downhill in search of food.",

It has four arms, each with a three-fingered hand. Its second pair of arms is typically kept tucked against its chest. It was shown in Pok\u00e9mon Snap that, despite having legs, it can revert to a legless form. This grants it the ability to float.\nGraveler's preferred locomotion is rolling, specifically, because it is a slow walker. It often rolls down mountain paths at high speeds exceeding 60 mph, crushing objects in the way and stopping by running into huge rocks should it build up too much speed. However, it will explode if it rolls into a river instead. Graveler is known to be generally free and uncaring, not minding if pieces of itself break off, as it can restore itself over time. Graveler climbs a mountain from base to summit, feasting on rocks all the while. Graveler's favorite rock to eat is moss-covered rocks. It regularly consumes tons of moss-covered rocks and makes loud noises while eating. Upon reaching the peak, it rolls down to the bottom. Graveler live in horizontal holes that they gouge out in sheer cliff faces , and they are capable of withstanding volcanic temperatures. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Graveler is known to rock back and forth while sleeping. It is believed that Graveler is dreaming about rolling down hilly paths.",

Its body is so hard that even dynamite cannot scratch it. Its head protrudes from the center of the shell. The head has a flat snout with two pointed teeth in the lower jaw and red eyes. It has short arms that have three claws and two legs with feet that have four claws in front and one in back. The head and limbs are light brown.\nGolem grows bigger by shedding its skin once a year. The discarded shell immediately hardens when exposed to air, crumbling away and returning to the soil. Farmers are known to collect Golem's shells. Golem's soil is spread across fields to promote crop growth. However, it stops shedding with age and moss grows over its shell. As shown in the Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards , Golem's shell is hollow.\nAs shown in The Bridge Bike Gang , Golem can withdraw its head and limbs into its shell and roll at high speeds. It is dangerous when doing this, as it is unable to see and may crash into or run over anything in its path. To prevent it from rolling into the homes of people downhill, grooves are dug into the sides of the mountains to divert the rolling Golem's course. It is seldom seen in the wild. However, it can be found living in mountainous regions. Golem are known to detonate their own body. It uses this explosive force to jump from mountain to mountain. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Golem is known to occasionally sleep upside down. It is believed that Golem rocks itself into a deep slumber, similar to a cradle. However, there's a chance a sleeping Golem may roll into anyone nearby it. Hence, its best to stay clear of Golem while it sleeps.",

Yellow and reddish-orange flames make up its mane and tail. The mane forms a short crest on top of its head and a short strip down its back to its tail. Additional flames are present behind its elbows and knees. The fire appears about an hour after hatching. It has four long legs, each ending in a single, gray hoof. These hooves are said to be ten times harder than diamonds and act as shock absorbers.\nPonyta are relatively lightweight for their size, as they have extraordinary jumping abilities and are capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound. However, a newborn Ponyta is a weak runner and is actually barely able to stand. It gradually strengthens its legs and becomes faster by chasing after its parents and jumping over grass that grows taller by the day. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Flame Pok\u00e9mon-athon! , it is shown that Ponyta can control its flames so that its rider is not burned by them, and Ponyta only does this for those that it has accepted. Ponyta herds tend to live in grasslands , plains, mountains, or anywhere that they can run freely.",

Flames are also present on its fetlocks . It has slender legs, each with a single black hoof.\nRapidash is a very agile Pok\u00e9mon. It runs at about 150\u00a0mph (240\u00a0km/h), chasing everything that moves in hopes of racing it. With incredible acceleration, it reaches its top speed in only ten steps. At full gallop, its hooves barely touch the ground. The faster Rapidash goes, the longer the swaying flames of its mane will become. At an all-out gallop, its blazing mane sparkles, a feature that is said to enhance its beautiful appearance. Rapidash is capable of traveling an entire region like Hisui within a day and a half. Rapidash lives in grasslands , but it can also be seen on mountains in Pok\u00e9mon Snap .",

            "description": "Slowpoke is a pink Pok\u00e9mon that resembles a cross between a salamander and a hippopotamus . It has vacant eyes that never seem focused, curled ears, and a rounded, tan muzzle. It has four legs, each of which ends in a single white claw. Its long, tapering tail has a white tip. This tail drips a sweet, sappy substance that is attractive to many species of fish. Slowpoke uses the tail as a fishing lure. The tail often breaks off, but it will grow back. Slowpoke tails are considered a delicacy and commonly used as a cooking ingredient: in Alola , they are often dried and used in home-cooked stews, while in Galar , they are smoked and packaged as a curry ingredient. Slowpoke is also known to dive underwater to hunt, but is often itself caught instead.\nSlowpoke has a notoriously dim intellect and often forgets what it was doing. It takes a long time to respond to outside stimuli. For example, it can take up to five seconds to process pain and can take an entire day to notice when its tail has been bitten. Slowpoke is commonly found at the water's edge . In some places, it is believed that Slowpoke's yawn causes rain. This Pok\u00e9mon is worshiped in those areas. Its vacant expression is said to help some people relax, whilst causing irritation to others. It is posited that those who lead hectic lives are most likely to become relaxed. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , researchers have debated if Slowpoke is either awake or asleep while it stands around doing nothing. [1]",

It has large, vacant eyes, curled ears, and two small pointed teeth protruding from its upper jaw. It has three clawed fingers on its hands and two clawed toes on its feet. There is a Shellder attached to its tail. This Shellder has a gray, spiral shell with darker gray spots and small, triangular eyes near the base. There are several spikes across the surface of the Shellder, and it holds onto Slowbro with many sharp teeth. Shellder developed its spiral form in an effort to suck more sweetness out of Slowbro's tail. If its tail or the Shellder attached to it is broken off, Slowbro will revert to its unevolved form, Slowpoke .\nSlowbro has lost the capability to feel pain due to the Shellder's poison. While typically lazy and unintelligent, Slowbro apparently becomes inspired when the Shellder bites down on its tail. While it is capable of unleashing powerful psychic attacks, Slowbro is typically rather peaceful and usually prefers not to fight. Because it can no longer fish using its tail, it instead swims to catch its prey and allows the Shellder to feed on its leftover scraps. Slowbro tends to live near ponds, lakes, and seashores . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Slowbro usually sleeps at the same time Shellder bites its tail. On occasion, Slowbro sleeps even when Shellder is still awake.",

            "description": "Magnemite is a seemingly robotic Pok\u00e9mon that has a gray, spherical metal body, with blue-and-red tipped horseshoe magnets on each side and a single, large eye. It has three Phillips head screws on its body: two near the bottom of its body and the one on top of its head that looks similar to an antenna. The two bottom screws serve no noticeable purpose, although they may be its feet as the Pok\u00e9dex identifies a footprint similar to that of the screw's head. Even though Magnemite and its evolved forms are mechanical creatures, it is shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Get Along, Little Pok\u00e9mon that it has emotions and a way of reproducing. In The Pok\u00e9 Spokesman , it exhibited the need to eat, although its main form of nutrition are electrical currents. It is commonly found in locations such as power plants or caves with a strong magnetic field. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, Magnemite has been depicted in carvings discovered at the Ruins of Alph . It has also been present in AZ 's retelling of the Kalos war, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years.\nThe magnetic units on Magnemite's body generate an electromagnetic field that allows it to defy gravity and can potentially disrupt electrical equipment. The units generate stronger magnetic fields the faster they rotate. Magnemite is not known to be unnecessarily aggressive but they may approach Trainers with little notice. If a wild Magnemite is approached, it may simply flee on rare occasions, as Magnemite does not care for interaction. However, if attacked, it will retaliate with non-damaging moves. In the care of a Trainer, it can be a devoted fighter. However, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Pok\u00e9 Spokesman , it's shown that it may be deterred unless a strong bond is formed with its Trainer. Should it run out of electricity, Magnemite will fall to the ground. Usually, batteries can help recharge it in order for Magnemite to start moving again.\nMagnemite can be attracted to anything emitting electricity or a magnetic field, including gadgets such as a Pok\u00e9tch . In the episode Sparks Fly for Magnemite , it is shown to be attracted to electric Pok\u00e9mon producing such fields. With modern electrical lines buried underground, Magnemite attacks on power plants have increased. To prevent power outages, these power plants deliberately send out signals Magnemite cannot stand to ward them off. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Magnemite is known to sleep airbone by generating electromagnetic waves from its side magnets. There are rare occasions where while Magnemite sleeps and muddles to the direction of its waves, it will loop in the air while sleeping.",

            "description": "Magneton is a robot-like Pok\u00e9mon , the result of three Magnemite becoming linked together by a strong magnetic force, although a single Magnemite can evolve by itself when there are no other Magnemite in the vicinity. Each individual Magnemite has a gray spherical body with a single eye, and a gray and red-and-blue tipped horseshoe magnet on each side. The topmost Magnemite has three Phillips head screws on its body, while the others appear to have only two. The three Magnemite that Magneton consists of can be linked in several ways. Magneton is most commonly seen as one Magnemite on top, and two Magnemite linked by the screws on the bottom, forming a triangle. In some cases, commonly seen in 3D games such as Pok\u00e9mon Snap , the Magnemite will not be connected at all, remain in a triangular formation at rest, and are able to freely move within each other's vicinity to form other patterns. In this case, all three Magnemite have three screws. The magnetic forces that hold the three Magnemite together are powerful enough to dry up all moisture and raise the temperature by 3.6\u00a0\u00b0F (2\u00a0\u00b0C) within a radius of 3,300 feet (one kilometer). It can also be disruptive to electronic devices and induce earaches. It uses powerful radio waves to help it study the surrounding area.\nMagneton's anti-gravitational powers enable it to fly through the air. Being composed of three Magnemite, it is about three times as powerful electrically, though not three times as intelligent. Even though Magneton is a mechanical creature, it still has the need to eat. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Pok\u00e9 Spokesman , food for Magneton consists of electrical currents. It is usually found in rough terrain , often near power plants .\nWhen sunspots flare up, Magneton tends to appear more often, presumably due to the changes in the sun's magnetic field. When rain clouds form, it also gathers in high areas prone to lightning strikes. As seen in the eleventh chapter of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , it possesses the ability to form its electricity into both platforms and barriers. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series episode The Future I Choose , it can cause interference with phone and internet signels. In An Unexpected Picnic! , a herd of Magneton can produce an EMP that can destroy computer software. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, carvings depicting Magneton have been discovered at the Ruins of Alph . One was shown in the Pok\u00e9mon Generations episode The Redemption in a flashback to the great war of Kalos , indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years. Additionally, Sandy Shocks bears a strong resemblance to Magneton. It is believed to be an ancient Magneton that was alive 10,000 years ago. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Magneton is known to sleep with its three linked Magnemite either stuck together or drifting apart by a strong magnetic force. It is theoried that its magnetism is unstable while Magneton sleeps.",

            "description": "Farfetch'd is an avian Pok\u00e9mon that resembles a light brown duck with a white underbelly. It has a flat, yellow beak, brown eyes, a V-shaped black marking on its forehead (similar to a unibrow ), and a three-feather crest on top of its head. Its wings are as big as its body and appear to be prehensile enough to substitute for hands. It has yellow legs with webbed feet and a stubby tail.\nFarfetch'd is always seen carrying a leek stalk or spring onion. It carries this sprig in its wings, but sometimes chooses to hold it in its beak or feet instead. Unable to live without its stick, Farfetch'd will defend it with its life. Losing the stalk can leave Farfetch'd defenseless, and it will seek out a new one to replace it. Known uses for the stick include use as a weapon, nesting material, and emergency food source. When using the stalk to attack, Farfetch'd wields and uses it like a sword to cut through things. There are several different fighting styles involving Farfetch'd's leek. It is selective about which sticks it will use and has been known to fight over good ones. Farfetch'd is found in temperate grasslands where reedy plants grow, guarding the plants from anyone trying to disturb them. However, Farfetch'd is rarely seen, and thus it is thought that its numbers are decreasing, and that it is at risk of extinction. According to sources such as Pok\u00e9mon the Series and the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia , its population decline is caused by humans who hunted it down for food ; one popular recipe suggested cooking it with its own leek. There have been attempts at breeding in order to increase the Farfetch'd population. In the Pikachu short Pikachu's Vacation , Farfetch'd are shown to be able to swim like real-life ducks.\nFarfetch'd and Sirfetch'd are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Leek item.",

It has a bristly, down-like covering of brown feathers on its body and both heads. A male has black flexible necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs. Each foot has four digits ending in a sharp claw. Both heads have an identical brain. However, it is believed that on occasion they may possess different brains. It is also theorized that the two heads communicate with some form of telepathy for coordination. Even when sleeping or nourishing itself with food and water, one head is usually awake and alert and keeps a keen eye out for enemies. The two heads switch turns every hour or so, with both only sleeping at the same time when they feel completely safe. Both heads have the same genes and battle together in perfect sync.\nDue to its almost non-existent wings, it cannot fly very well. However, it has developed legs that make it a powerful runner. Reaching speeds of 60 mph (100 km/h), it energetically strides across the plains leaving large 4-inch (10-centimeter) deep footprints behind it. It can better maintain balance while running by raising and lowering its two heads. Doduo lives in wide open plains, grasslands, and savannahs.",

            "description": "Dodrio is a large, wingless, three-headed avian Pok\u00e9mon . Each head has a long, sharp beak and a black V-shaped, feather crest. It has bristly brown feathers covering its head and upper body, while its lower half has a smooth layer of black feathers. Its tail consists of three pale red feathers with lighter tips. Its wingless body rests on two long and slender, but powerful legs with feet that have three clawed toes in front and one in back. A male has black necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs.\nEach head has its own working brain and distinct personality. Each head represents and expresses either sorrow, anger, or joy. Despite being separate, it has the innate ability to use all three of its brains to collect data, formulate, and then execute complex plans and strategies. However, on occasion, it may overthink, which causes it to become immobilized and unable to carry out any action whatsoever. Being separate individuals on the same body, the three heads will continue to bicker until they, or at least one of them, gets to eat. This satisfies the other two heads, quelling them and temporarily ending their infighting. The strongest of Dodrio's heads and the thickest neck will become the leader and gain primary control of the body. Another form of adaptation that it has acquired is the ability to have at least one head alert at all times. Extreme caution is advised when all three heads are facing separate directions. It is in this state that it is the most dangerous and going near it may result in a severe pecking.\nAlong with its three heads, it has three sets of hearts and lungs as well. This allows it to efficiently oxygenate and pump blood throughout its body, thus giving it increased endurance to run vast distances without rest. It is especially prone to race vigorously across grassy plains , even in arid seasons with little rainfall. As a result, despite being slower than Doduo , Dodrio can keep running for an even longer time. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Dodrio is known to usually sleep standing up. Each of the three heads taking turns sleeping while one head stays awake. However, should Dodrio become very tired, even the head that remains awake may start to doze off.",

It has two large eyes with beady pupils and a gaping mouth with a gray tongue. While it lacks any visible legs, it does have two arms with three digits on each hand. Its purple sludge body contains a variety of pungent bacteria, which are so potent that it renders soil barren and incapable of supporting plant life. It is constantly oozing a bacteria-rich fluid from all parts of its body. Should it run out of internal germs, Grimer will die. Pieces of it often break off during travel and go on to become new Grimer. When combined with another Grimer, it produces new poisonous compounds.\nDue to its lack of a solid form, Grimer is capable of squeezing into any space or crevices with relative ease. It uses this to penetrate sewage pipes and feed off of the filthy wastewater inside. Its population fluctuates based on the availability of waste, which is Grimer's main diet. It can be found in polluted lakes and streams, as well as within cities and factories where trash and industrial waste can be found. In recent years, thanks to efforts in environmental improvements and a decrease in their food source of waste, Grimer is now facing extinction.\nPrior to Generation IV , Grimer and its evolved form, Muk , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Stench as an Ability .",

It also has an enormous mouth with a gray tongue and strands of ooze connecting its top and bottom jaws. While it has no visible legs, it does have two arms with three fingers on each hand. However, it typically keeps one hand tucked in while it extends the other hand.\nMuk is a living biohazard, leaking toxins that instantly kill all plant life it touches. Even it being in close proximity to plants will cause them to wilt and die. Extreme caution is advised in avoiding any contact with this Pok\u00e9mon, as an accidental brush-up can lead to severe sickness. The effects of this Pok\u00e9mon can leave the landscape barren for three years. It will readily consume nearly any waste or refuse generated by people and Pok\u00e9mon alike. Muk's body produces a powerful odor that can cause fainting. However, despite the risk Muk's stench contains, some fans of Muk believe its stench is a good thing.\nMuk can be found in heavily polluted bodies of water, factories and cities , where groups can gather to consume trash that people throw away into the streets. However, Muk's population has declined due to recent environmental improvements and extermination efforts. This has led some to believe that it will go extinct at some point; sludge ponds are being built to prevent its extinction.\nPrior to Generation IV , Muk and its pre-evolved form, Grimer, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Stench as an Ability .",

            "description": "Shellder is a bivalve mollusk Pok\u00e9mon encased within a spiky, blue-violet bivalve shell. It has two round white eyes with tiny black pupils. Its enormously long red tongue is used to burrow itself into the sand to sleep overnight and also to lure and capture prey. The tongue protrudes even when its shell is closed and tugging it will cause the shell to pop open. Its soft and tender body is well-protected by its extremely durable shell, which is purported to be harder than diamonds and has historically been used by people to make shields. It can make pearls from accumulated sand, though it discards them as they are typically in its way.\nShellder has an unusually strong appetite for the tail of a Slowpoke and can develop a symbiotic relationship with the Dopey Pok\u00e9mon. After attaching itself to the Slowpoke's tail, the two undergo a metamorphosis and evolve into Slowbro together. Alternatively, if it attaches to the head of a Slowpoke in possession of a King's Rock , the two will instead evolve into Slowking . These relationships allow it to travel onto land and begin a new stage in its life cycle. In Galar , Shellder attaches to the forearms and heads of Galarian Slowpoke wearing Galarica Cuffs or Galarica Wreaths , causing the evolution into Galarian Slowbro and Galarian Slowking, respectively.\nRegardless of which form the two Pok\u00e9mon evolve into, Shellder's shell transforms into a spiny, spiraled cone with several tiers. Sharp teeth develop around the rim of the shell to anchor it securely to the evolved Slowpoke, and its eyes now peek out from the bottom rim of the shell. In its crown form, Shellder will have a red jewel on its underside and a large horn on either side of its shell.\nWhile in its crown form, Shellder will periodically release its venom into Slowking's brain. This is actually beneficial to Slowking, as it causes the Regal Pok\u00e9mon's intelligence to increase. Higher quantities of venom intensify this effect, and Shellder is easily provoked into releasing more whenever Slowking yawns. However, Shellder's poison makes Slowbro more sluggish as it continues to drain nutrients from its host's body. As seen in Slowking's Crowning! and An Evolution in Taste! , the crown form of Shellder can take control of humans who wear it and speak through its hoist. The control of Shellder wears off the moment the crown is removed.\nDespite its hard shell, clamping on to an opponent will reveal its vulnerable parts. Because of this, it will only clamp itself to a foe as a last resort. It swims around its seafloor home by rapidly opening and closing its shell while facing backward. Despite its appearance, Shellder is surprisingly fast. Prehistoric Shellder were apparently preyed upon by Omastar , whose powerful bites were capable of breaking through its shell. Shellder and its evolved form, Cloyster, are related to Shellos and Gastrodon . Kingler , Rufflet , and Bruxish are modern predators of Shellder.\nPrior to Generation III , Clamp was its signature move . Prior to Generation V , Icicle Spear was also its signature move, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding . Additionally, prior to Generation V, Shellder and its evolved form, Cloyster, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Skill Link as an Ability .",

            "description": "Cloyster is a black bivalve mollusk Pok\u00e9mon . It is encased inside a light-gray shell, which is surrounded by a second jagged, blue-violet outer shell casing. It has one barb-like spike protruding from above its head, and multiple conical horns on its outer shell. Its shell is harder than a diamond with spikes that are even harder; harsh tidal currents will affect the size and sharpness of these spikes. On its pearl-like face, it has two white eyes and a mouth. Aside from its face and head, its internal anatomy has never been seen. Once it has shut itself in, it is impossible to open its shell from the outside. This impressive defense allows it to withstand anything from a bomb blast to even a missile strike.\nCloyster typically only opens its shell to attack an opponent. However, it is fully capable of retaliating against any enemy with its shell tightly closed. With rapid succession, it launches its spikes at the foe, keeping them repelled. The same projectile system it uses to launch its spikes is also used for swimming. It swallows seawater and then ejects it towards the rear, pushing it through with siphon-jet propulsion. Being the result of Shellder evolving through an Evolution stone , Cloyster is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found on the sea floor , nestled among the rocks and coral; however, it will actively hunt on land for Slowpoke tails. Cloyster and its pre-evolved form, Shellder , are relatives of Gastrodon . Kingler is a natural predator of Cloyster.\nIn Generation I , Clamp was its signature move . Additionally, prior to Generation V , Cloyster and its pre-evolved form, Shellder, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Skill Link as an Ability .",

            "description": "Gastly has no true form, due to 95% of its body being poisonous gas, with the other 5% believed to be made up of the souls of those who died from the gas. However, it consistently appears as a black, spherical Pok\u00e9mon surrounded by a purple haze. Gastly has a wide, pink mouth with two visible fangs. Though its eyes seem to extend past its round body, visible eyelids surround them.\nIt produces a faint, sweet smell. The toxic gas surrounding the main body can induce fainting and suffocation, and it is capable of enshrouding an enemy of any size. Gastly's gaseous form makes it one of the lightest Pok\u00e9mon in existence. The Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Tower of Terror suggests that Gastly has a playful personality, often frightening and playing pranks on people for fun. However, in the episode A Shipful of Shivers , it shows a willingness to preserve or pass on the memories of departed humans. It is also shown in The Ghost of Maiden's Peak changing form and creating illusions, and it is capable of phasing through solid objects and forming tangible hands out of its gasses. Gastly can be found within caves and old, dilapidated buildings, but may also be seen outdoors during nighttime. Its gaseous body will dwindle away when exposed to strong winds, so they huddle together in decent-sized groups under house eaves to avoid the wind. It may also cause flickering lights in abandoned houses. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Gastly is known to sleep while floating. A sleeping Gastly is said give a sudden surprise should someone approach it.\nIn Generation I , Night Shade was its signature move .",

Disembodied hands with three clawed fingers each float in front of its body. Its body tapers into a jagged tail. Haunter's gaseous form makes it one of the lightest Pok\u00e9mon in existence.\nHaunter hides in very dark places, such as caves , and is afraid of light. If a human or a Pok\u00e9mon comes near Haunter, it will stalk the victim while floating and beckon it to come closer. Once approached it will then lick the victim with its gaseous tongue, inflicting convulsions in the victim that last until death. It can also float through walls. It has been shown in Pok\u00e9mon the Series that it can control its hands from far away and can control any Pok\u00e9mon that it touches with its hands. Haunter have also been depicted as being able to create illusions, pull out spirits from an individual\u2019s body, and even remove its own eyes from its face . Despite its predatory nature, it is known to entertain and prank people, such as in the episode The Tower of Terror .

It also has a stubby tail.\nGengar has the ability to hide perfectly in the shadow of any object, granting it exceptional stealth. However, Gengar's body acts as a heat sink . Its presence cools the temperature of the surrounding area by nearly 10\u00a0\u00b0F (5\u00a0\u00b0C), because it absorbs the warmth. It is shown in Pok\u00e9mon the Series that Gengar can fly, possess people and other Pok\u00e9mon, create illusions and extend its tongue by several meters. In Generation I , Night Shade was its signature move .\nGengar is very mischievous, and at times, malicious. It enjoys playing practical jokes and casting curses, such as pretending to be one's shadow, then behaving erratically. When the quarry notices, the Gengar takes delight in its victim's terror. However, Gengar has been known to be loyal to a Trainer who treats it well. Being the result of an evolution via trading , Gengar is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in caves and dark places where shadows form. It is especially fond of urban areas such as cities and back alleys, but only during the night. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Gengar is known to sleep deeply while hiding in the shadow of a target it plans to curse. [5]",

            "description": "Onix is a Pok\u00e9mon composed of a giant chain of gray boulders that become smaller towards the tail. Its length makes it the tallest Rock-type Pok\u00e9mon. It has black eyes and a rounded snout. On top of its head is a rocky spine. As it grows older, it becomes more rounded and smoother, eventually becoming similar to black diamonds. Inside its brain is a magnet that serves as an internal compass, guiding Onix wherever they need to go and prevents them from getting lost while digging.\nOnix tunnels under the ground at over 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour, which causes tremors and a terrifying roar that echoes a long way. Hard objects encountered while tunneling are absorbed into its body, which makes it very sturdy. It also consumes the boulders for food. The massive, winding tunnels it leaves behind are used as homes by Diglett . As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon Stadium series , Onix is capable of rotating its head, or any part of its body, in a full 360 degrees. It is a very aggressive Pok\u00e9mon that will constantly attack humans and other Pok\u00e9mon when in pain, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode To Master the Onixpected! . As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon Adventures manga, Onix can be separated from its body segments in battle and be fine later on, either regenerating or reattaching to its body segments. It is said that an Onix that lives for about 100 years will evolve into a Steelix after its composition becomes more diamond-like. It can be found in mountains and caves . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Onix is known on occasion to sleep while in the middle of digging through tunnels. Onix is believed to be a deep sleeper due to the protection offered by its sturdy body.",

This is so it knows what kind of dream it would be eating. It has certain preferences for the dreams it eats, and it is known to love fun dreams and become ill from bad dreams. It will rarely eat the dreams of adults, as the dreams of children are seemingly tastier. Drowzee remembers every dream it has eaten and may show past meals to a person it trusts. It eats dreams through the victim's nose, so it is said that Drowzee is standing over a person's pillow if their nose itches while they are asleep. Drowzee lives in grasslands and savannas .",

It carries away people having good dreams and is even known to have stolen a child at one point. However, in the Alola region , it preys primarily on Komala , and cases of Hypno targeting humans are notably rare. Some Hypno are even known to assist doctors in hospitals when their patients cannot sleep at night.

Each leg has a single, claw-like foot. The main features of Krabby's body are the two large, red pincers at the end of its arms. Krabby uses them as its main form of offense, and as a form of balance. Sometimes, Krabby may lose a claw during battle or have a damaged claw forcibly removed. However, the claw regenerates over a short period.\nIn the wild, Krabby lives near the edge of water in both fresh and salt water. Krabby is most commonly found on beaches where it burrows in the sand. In times of scarce food sources, it may eat sand to regain nutrients and will be very aggressive in defending its home. Its main form of defense is creating foam to shroud its body, in order to confuse opponents into thinking that it is bigger than it actually is. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Mystery at the Lighthouse , Krabby generally keeps to itself, but will quickly defend itself if provoked.\nPrior to Generation III , Krabby and its evolved form, Kingler , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Crabhammer .",

            "description": "Kingler is a crustacean Pok\u00e9mon resembling a crab . Its strong shell covers the outside of its body, featuring a red upper half and a light tan lower half. Its upper half is topped with six tall, thin spikes that resemble a crown. Its light tan arms are also connected to its upper body. Its lower half doubles as its jaw with six fangs overlapping its upper body. Its two outer fangs are much larger than the inner four and are roughly half as tall as Kingler's entire body. Its hips visibly protrude from its lower body and connect to its four long, thin legs. Each leg has a single, claw-like foot. Kingler's main features are its orange pincers. Its left claw is roughly twice as large as the other and is as hard as steel.\nKingler is often found on the edges of water , usually the ocean. Its powerful claws have 10,000 horsepower and are capable of prying open the shells of Shellder and Cloyster . While Kingler's large, left claw is its main tool for offensive maneuvers, it is so large and heavy that Kingler can barely lift it. It causes balancing problems and Kingler may quickly become fatigued from continuous use. However, it has been shown to communicate with other Kingler by waving its pincers around.\nPrior to Generation III , Kingler and its pre-evolved form, Krabby , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Crabhammer .",

Each \"head\" has a slightly different facial expression, but each face has triangular eyes with tiny black pupils and a small mouth. Each shell has some cracks, and one member of the bundle usually has its yellow insides or brain exposed. More numerous cracks are a sign that it is close to evolution. Despite looking like eggs, Exeggcute is actually more closely related to plant seeds . It is believed to carry genes of plants and other species.\nExeggcute gather in swarms of six. The heads communicate with each other by using a form of telepathy that only they can understand. Should the number of Exeggcute be reduced to less than six, the remaining Exeggcute will attempt to replace it with a similarly sized Pok\u00e9mon as seen in the Pikachu short Pikachu's Rescue Adventure . It needs six Exeggcute in order to stay balanced or else it becomes nervous and cowardly. Pidgeotto and Crabrawler are its natural predators, which it chases off with psychokinesis. Exeggcute inhabits jungles and forests . Exeggcute in the Alola region tend to be heavier than those from elsewhere. This is due to the shells being packed full.\nExeggcute and its evolved form, Exeggutor , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Barrage .",

            "description": "Exeggutor is a tall, bipedal Pok\u00e9mon that resembles a coconut tree or palm tree. Its body and legs are light brown with thin black rings and its legs are thick with two-toed feet. There is a light yellow paw pad on each foot's underside. It has thin, green leaves sprouting from the top of its body. Exeggutor has three round, light yellow heads that resemble coconuts, each with different facial expressions.\nExeggutor's heads think independently and don't appear interested in one another, so it makes a lot of noise as each head speaks its mind. They still appear to get along, though, for they never squabble amongst themselves. If all the heads want to go in a different direction, its body is unable to move. They are able to communicate telepathically as well and sometimes use it to come to a joint decision. It uses psychic powers to fight, and since all three heads are capable its power is tripled. If one of these heads grows too large, it falls off and groups together with others to become an Exeggcute . In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The March of the Exeggutor Squad , Exeggutor also has been seen in groups of its own kind, meaning that it is not a solitary Pok\u00e9mon. Exeggutor has been referred to as \"The Walking Tropical Rainforest\" or \"The Walking Jungle\". It can be sluggish during cloudy days due to the lack of sunlight. Being the result of an evolution via Evolution stone , Exeggutor is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in forests and jungles .\nExeggutor and its pre-evolved form, Exeggcute , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Barrage .",

            "description": "Cubone is a small, bipedal, dinosaur -like reptilian Pok\u00e9mon with a light brown hide that covers most of its body, except for its cream-colored belly. Two small claws, one on each hand, serve as its thumbs, and one large nail on each foot make up its toes. It has two small spikes on its back and a short tail. On its head, Cubone wears the skull of its dead mother as a helmet. Because of this, much of its actual face has never been seen, except for its triangular, black eyes and a small area surrounding them. The skull has two rounded horns on the top of its head and a tooth-like point on the lower sides. Under the skull, Cubone has a brown snout. The small Cubone survives only through the immense skill it possesses in wielding the bone it carries as a weapon.\nIt is called the Lonely Pok\u00e9mon because of its tendency to keep to itself and avoid social situations, due to the trauma caused by the death of its mother. Cubone will often weep at night in mourning of its mother. When Cubone cries, the skull that it wears on its head vibrates and emits \"a plaintive and mournful sound.\" On the night of a full moon, the cries are said to be especially terrible. Cubone seems to recognize its mother in the full moon, and so it howls with a particular sadness. Its cries attract Mandibuzz , a natural predator. It is said a Cubone will evolve into a Marowak once it comes terms with its mother's death. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Cubone is known to cry while sleeping. It is theorized that Cubone's dreams are about its deceased mother. The dreams Cubone have make it cry, but crying makes it stronger. Cubone lives in rocky areas, usually on mountains or in caves. It also once inhabited the Pok\u00e9mon Tower in Lavender Town where deceased Pok\u00e9mon were buried and mourned.\nCubone and its evolved form, Marowak , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Bone Club and Bonemerang . Cubone and Marowak are also the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Thick Club item. In Generations II and III , Bone Rush was another one of their signature moves.",

Marowak is well known for its ferocity with its bone club, which it is said to collect from a hidden graveyard. Despite its small size, Marowak's body is as sturdy as armor .\nUpon evolution, Marowak has overcome the grief of its mother's passing. Now ferocious and violent, Marowak is an adept combatant that uses the bone it carries as a weapon and a boomerang. Having evolved, it seeks vengeance on its natural enemy Mandibuzz , which prey on Cubone because of its naturally weak and timid demeanor. Marowak has also been recorded pounding on boulders with the bone club it carries to tap out messages to others. It lives in mountains to test its skills. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Marowak is known to sleep while using its bone similar to a pillow, possibly being at peace.

            "description": "Hitmonlee is a humanoid Pok\u00e9mon with an ovoid body. Lacking a distinct neck and head, its upper torso has almond-shaped eyes with black space around them and appears to lack a nose and mouth. Primarily brown, it has cream-colored, segmented arms and legs. Each hand has three fingers and each foot has three clawed toes. The soles of its feet and its ankles have circular, yellow pads. Hitmonlee is an exclusively male species with no female counterpart.\nHitmonlee's legs freely contract and stretch similar to a coiled spring (and one particular Hitmonlee can do this with its arms as well). The source of its power comes from the ligaments in its legs that Hitmonlee can fully control. This flexibility allows Hitmonlee to run with lengthy strides, giving it greater reach for its kicks. Its excellent sense of balance enables it to kick in succession from any position. Hitmonlee's kicking strength is incredibly powerful owing to its diamond-like soles. Right before kicking an opponent, Hitmonlee will harden the muscles on the sole of its foot, allowing it to maximize the full power of its kick. It has sometimes been nicknamed the \"Kick Master\". After battling, it rubs down its legs to relax the tight muscles. Rarely found in the wild, it is primarily found in urban areas . It has been seen competing with either Hitmonchan , or Hitmontop .\nHitmonlee has had several kicking moves as signature moves :\nPrior to Generation V , Reckless was Hitmonlee's signature Ability .",

There are five blunt protrusions on top of its head, and it has structures resembling pads over its shoulders. It appears to be wearing a light purple tunic and kilt, as well as red boxing gloves and light purple boxing shoes. The gloves are actually masses of muscle. In between the tunic and kilt is a small, black area.\nAs its appearance suggests, Hitmonchan specializes in punching. It can throw punches that are too quick to be seen with the naked eye. Its punches are said to be as fast as a bullet train. It starts attacking foes with combo punches from both sides before finishing with a single straight punch. A single straight punch by Hitmonchan can launch foes over 300 mph. By punching with a corkscrew motion, it is even capable of drilling through concrete. Even a light graze from its punches will result in a burn. However, Hitmonchan requires a break every three minutes while fighting. Despite the need for frequent breaks, it has an unwavering spirit and will never give up in a difficult situation. Usually found in urban areas , it is rarely seen in the wild. It often competes with Hitmonlee and Hitmontop .\nIn Generation II , Mach Punch was its signature move , but Tyrogue could still inherit it via breeding . Prior to Generation V , Iron Fist was Hitmonchan's signature Ability .",

It has soft, pink skin with curved yellow lines on its belly and a yellow ring marking on each knee. It has a thumb-like claw on each hand and a single large nail on each foot. There is a yellow spot on its palms and the soles of its feet. It has beady eyes and a long, prehensile tongue, with nerves that extend its entire length. The tongue is likely connected to its tail, which twitches and retracts when the tongue is pulled.\nAt over 6 feet 6 inches (2 meters), Lickitung's tongue is twice as long as its body. Sticky, smelly saliva coats its tongue, which causes a tingling sensation when touched and can cause rashes if not cleaned off. It is used for capturing prey (mainly Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon), reaching for berries , exploring its environment, attacking, and cleaning; although the effectiveness of its cleaning is questionable as its saliva leaves behind its smell. Lickitung's saliva can also be used as a strong adhesive after cooking it. Lickitung remembers things by their texture and taste, although it apparently dislikes sour things. The tongue is both dexterous and powerful enough to lift people, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Deceit and Assist . When capturing prey, Lickitung prefers swallowing them whole after paralyzing them with its tongue. Lickitung can be found in grassy plains and meadows .",

However, a full set of teeth is shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Black & White episode Rocking the Virbank Gym! Part 1 . Below its face is a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking. Several geyser-like protrusions, which usually release a mustard-colored gas, cover this Pok\u00e9mon's body. Koffing's purple skin is very thin, and over-inflation can cause it to explode. The Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards depicts Koffing as having a hollow body.\nKoffing creates gases within its body by mixing toxins with garbage, and produces more gas in higher temperatures. These gases are malodorous and cause sniffles, coughs, and teary eyes to those around them. The gases are also lighter than air, allowing Koffing to hover. When agitated, it creates a more toxic gas and expels it through the holes in its body. As shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Pok\u00e9mon Emergency! , Koffing's gas can be ignited by fire or electricity. It feeds on the fumes of raw, rotting trash found in gas dumps and polluted air. Koffing at one point was plentiful in Galar due to factories. Koffing is most often found in urban areas .\nKoffing and its evolution, Weezing , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Neutralizing Gas as an Ability .",

            "description": "Weezing is a purple Pok\u00e9mon consisting of two spherical heads connected by a thin tube with another sphere in the center. The heads have different sizes and features. The left head is larger and has prominent eyebrows, pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw, and two flat teeth in its upper jaw. The smaller, right head simply has two pointed teeth, one at each corner of its mouth. The larger head has a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking below its face, while the smaller head has a ring marking instead. It is covered with many geyser-like protrusions, which usually expel mustard-colored gases. Weezing is said to form when poisonous gases pool and two Koffing fuse over many years. Very rarely, two Koffing can become a Weezing in a short time span because of a sudden mutation. Triplet Weezing have been discovered, although they are extremely rare.\nEach of Weezing's heads contains a different toxin. It mixes its gases by inflating one head and deflating the other. When its gases mix, Weezing becomes more toxic and putrid. Weezing can hover in midair, presumably due to gases lighter than air, as is the case for Koffing. Despite their stench and poison, Weezing's gases can be used to make top-grade perfume by diluting them to the highest level.\nWeezing lives in urban areas . It seeks a dirty, unkempt house and nests there. At night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through the trash. Weezing feeds on the dust, microorganisms, and especially gases emitted by garbage and toxic waste. Weezing's body expands and smells worse upon inhaling poisonous gases. The Kantonian Weezing used to be common in Galar and created more potent toxins than their Galarian relatives.\nWeezing and its pre-evolved form are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Neutralizing Gas as an Ability .",

Its underside and rear are smooth, and it has four short legs with two claws on each foot. It has a triangular head with narrow, red eyes, two fangs protruding from its upper jaw, small, triangular openings on the upper sides, and a short horn on the tip of its snout. A female will have a shorter horn than a male. A spiked ridge runs along its back. In addition to its rocky hide, its bones are a thousand times harder than human bones.\nRhyhorn's brain is very small, giving it a one-track mind. When it runs, it forgets why it started and continues until it falls asleep. However, it may recall the reason for demolishing something. Due to its short legs, it is inept at turning and can only run in straight lines. It does not care if obstacles get in the way, merely smashing through them or sending them flying, although it may feel pain the day after a collision. This personality is how Rhyorn expands its territory. Rhyhorn is powerful enough to shatter skyscrapers or mountains instantly after charging forward with head tackles. Rhyhorn lives in rough terrain . A Rhyorn's territory expands to six miles.",

On the tip of Rhydon's snout is a cream-colored horn, which is smaller on a female than on a male. There are several other spikes and projections on its head: on top is a spike that curves forward, two triangular points resembling ears on the sides, a wide, wavy crest under each ear, and spiky ridges on each cheek. It has a cream-colored abdomen divided into strips by thin divots. A rocky plate on its chest slightly overlaps its abdomen. There is a row of spikes down its back and they have a long tail with thin, black stripes.\nRhydon is a physically powerful Pok\u00e9mon. It is recorded as being able to topple buildings with a sweeping blow of its tail, and its horn can bore through solid rock and shatter diamonds. Rhydon sharpens their horns by clashing them together. Its armor-like hide protects it from heat and physical blows. It is stated to be capable of passing unscathed through streams of magma (3,600 degrees Fahrenheit) and withstanding a direct blow from a cannonball without being harmed. However, because of this tough hide, it is insensitive. Despite its well-developed brain, it can be forgetful. Rhydon lives in rough terrain like in caves or on top of mountains. Due to its Evolution allowing Rhydon to walk on two legs, it can expand its territory to more than a Rhyhorn's original habitat limit.",

The tufts of hair have dark pink tips. On the center of its belly is a dark pink pouch that contains a single white egg. The egg is said to be very nutritious and it lays several new ones every day. Finally, it has a short tail. Chansey is a female-only species with no male counterpart.\nA kindhearted Pok\u00e9mon, Chansey will share its eggs with injured people and Pok\u00e9mon. However, Chansey will never share its egg to those with evil hearts. The eggs become more delicious if Chansey is raised with love and care. Chansey's egg is used as a high-class cooking ingredient due to the nutrition it has. As a result, Chansey have been referred to as doctors' doubles because of its eggs. Due to its egg being over-harvested, Chansey is extremely rare in the wild and is said to bring good luck and happiness to those who manage to catch it. Fleeing from those seeking its egg has made this once-slow species much quicker on its feet than in the past. It is more commonly found in urban settings . Chansey is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Lucky Punch item. In Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus , if the player is injured, any nearby Chansey will come to check them out, and then flee when they're fully healed. They don't actually heal the player, however.\nChansey and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Soft-Boiled by leveling up.",

Its vines are covered in fine hair and are always growing. If damaged or lost, replacements are grown. There is a pair of red boot-like feet poking out from under the vines, but no visible arms.\nTangela can ensnare and entangle anything that moves too close to it with its vines. The vines constantly jiggle and sway, unnerving enemies and causing a tickling sensation if ensnared. Tangela's vines will snap off easily and painlessly if the target pulls on them, so it can quickly escape. The vines of Tangela are said to have a refreshing flavor and scent. In Galar , its vines are used as herbs. Tangela can usually be found in temperate grasslands , and has been known to swing on tree branches using its vines.",

It has large, cream-colored ears, narrow, red eyes, and a short, rounded snout with two fangs in the back of its upper jaw. On top of its head is a thick, black plate. There are epaulette -like growths over its shoulders and a row of spikes down its back. It has three clawed digits on each hand and foot and a thick tail. On its belly is a pouch that contains a baby Kangaskhan. Unlike its parent, the baby is light purple and has smooth skin. Kangaskhan is a female-only species with no male counterpart.\nKangaskhan is a nurturing Pok\u00e9mon that protects its young at all costs. It can move really fast, even with the baby in its pouch. The baby leaves the pouch only rarely until it is three years old. In order to avoid crushing the baby, Kangaskhan sleeps standing up. If the mother feels the environment is safe, it will allow its young out to play. However, it will violently attack anything that it sees as a threat to its young. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Kangaskhan will defend the baby in its pouch, even while it sleeps. If the baby is awake but the parent wants to sleep, Kangaskhan will lie down to sleep while the baby sits on top of its back. They are known to raise other species of Pok\u00e9mon alongside their own children, and records exist which describe a childless Kangaskhan raising a lost human child. Regardless of how badly injured it becomes, the mother will not cease fighting until its young is safe. It uses quick jabs to intimidate its enemies. Although it was nearly hunted to extinction, Kangaskhan can be found in savannahs and other grasslands .\nPrior to Generation III , Dizzy Punch was its signature move .",

It has a tightly curled tail that it can use as both a balance and an anchor when caught in a strong current. In safer environments, it uses its tail to play with other members of its species.\nHorsea feeds on insects and moss gathered from rocks. If Horsea senses danger, it sprays water or dense black ink from its mouth at its attacker. It can shoot more precisely at insects flying above the surface of the water. Horsea nests in coral reefs and islands throughout oceans with gentle currents . Many Eggs are laid every year, and the young are raised by the male Horsea rather than the female. Horsea swims with dance-like motions, creating whirlpools in the process. It tends to compete with each other to see who can create the biggest whirlpool.",

It has a long, tubular mouth, narrow, black eyes, a fin-like ridge above each eye, and spiny pectoral fins . It also has a large, coiled tail. It has a pair of dorsal fins with sharp, cream-colored tips that exude venom. Seadra's venom is toxic enough to induce numbness and even fainting in humans, but it is still prized among practitioners of traditional medicine.\nSeadra can swim in any direction while facing forward by rapidly flapping its fins and tail. It catches its prey by spinning its body to create large whirlpools. When its prey is exhausted, Seadra swallows it whole using its long snout. Seadra makes its nest by either wriggling between or anchoring itself to branches of coral under the ocean . After a female Seadra gives birth, the male Seadra will take care of the young. It is markedly vicious and will mercilessly attack those who venture near its nest. During this time, the male's venom also becomes thicker and stronger than usual.",

Goldeen's billowing tail fin is orange around the base and turns white toward the edges. Its tail is admired by many for its beauty and similarity to a ballroom dress.\nGoldeen has a wild temperament and will use its horn to smash its way to freedom if kept in an aquarium. It competes with others of its kind to determine which has the strongest, thickest horn. Humans swimming near it must exercise caution lest Goldeen rams them. Goldeen is a very common sight in any body of fresh water , including ponds, lakes, and rivers. It can be seen swimming upstream in large schools during the breeding season in spring. Its strong fins allow it to maintain a steady speed of five knots while swimming upstream. It is known as the \"Water Dancer\" due to its elegant movements in the water.

It has round, dark eyes, prominent pink lips, two small fangs, and a cream-colored horn in the center of its forehead. A female will have a smaller horn than a male. Most of its body is orange with a patch of white under its mouth and along its underside. There are several black markings on its body: two thick lines under each eye, a large wavy patch on its back, and several speckles near its tail. It has billowing pectoral fins and a pair of tail fins shaped like butterfly wings, all of which are white speckled with black. However, its dorsal fin is pure white and rigid.\nSeaking is a very powerful swimmer that is found in rivers and streams . It can swim not only against a river's current, but up waterfalls as well. In the autumn spawning season, it grows fatter and more vibrant. It travels upriver where male Seaking engage in elaborate dances to court females. The female would go for the Seaking with the most graceful dance.\nSeaking uses its powerful horn to bore holes in riverbed boulders in order to shelter its Eggs from water currents. A mated pair take turns patrolling around their new nest for roughly a month and defend it with their lives. There are two different groups of Trainers who are obsessed with Seaking's horns or dorsal fins. However, the groups cannot get along with each other.

            "description": "Staryu is a golden-brown, echinoderm Pok\u00e9mon with five appendages. These appendages surround an exterior organ called the core. The core resembles a golden metal casing with a red gem in the center, which is held in place by a golden ring looped around Staryu's lower left point. If any of Staryu's appendages are lost or eaten by predators like Lumineon , it is unharmed and can grow them back with ease provided the core is still intact.\nWhen the sun goes down, Staryu's core glows its brightest. Many Staryu will float from the seafloor to the surface and align themselves with stars of the night sky as their core flickers, displaying a connection with the celestial bodies of space. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Bye Bye Psyduck , it is shown that if Staryu becomes weak, its core will grow faint and flash slowly. During the ends of summer, groups of Staryu tend to gather while lighting up in a steady rhythm. Staryu can be found at the very bottom of the ocean on the seafloors . There are times, however, when Staryu finds itself in rivers that lead into the ocean as seen in Pok\u00e9mon Snap . In Generation III , Camouflage was its signature move .\nIn the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia , and the original Japanese version of the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Water Flowers of Cerulean City , Staryu is classified as hermaphroditic .",

            "description": "Starmie is an echinoderm Pok\u00e9mon that resembles two violet starfish with five appendages each. The front starfish has a golden formation in the center. In the center of the golden casing is its red jewel core, which can glow in seven colors and has developed to resemble a cut precious stone. The second starfish is semi-attached to the back of the first and can spin 360 degrees. This rotational action is how Starmie swims through the ocean. It can also launch itself out of the water and fly through the air for short periods, as seen in Pok\u00e9mon Snap .\nFrom its core, Starmie can emit electrical waves that are powerful enough to reach the furthest parts of the universe. The multi-color glowing of its core is also believed to be a method of communication with other members of its species. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Water Flowers of Cerulean City , the core will go dark if Starmie is knocked unconscious and will sometimes flicker if Starmie is low on health. Because of its body shape and habit of sending transmissions skyward, some people believe this Pok\u00e9mon to be extraterrestrial . It has been known to cause headaches on people when approached. It is rarely seen in the wild since it requires a rare evolution stone to evolve, but it can be found in the deepest parts of the ocean . It feeds by absorbing tiny plankton into its body while swimming, and it is preyed on by Lumineon .",

            "description": "Mr. Mime is a bipedal, humanoid Pok\u00e9mon. Blue growths resembling clown hair extend from the sides of its pale pink head, and there is a magenta circle on each cheek. Its jaw is curved inward, resembling the mouth of a wooden dummy. It has a round, white body with a magenta spot in the middle, light pink arms and legs that connect to its body via magenta spheres, and small white coverings over its knees. Its white hands resemble gloves with magenta pads on the tips of its white fingers and its dark blue feet curl upward at the tips. From birth, this Pok\u00e9mon is an excellent pantomime. As it matures, it gains the ability to solidify air molecules by vibrating its fingertips. This ability allows it to create invisible objects with its gestures. It punishes those who interrupt its act or are not impressed by slapping them. In the TCG, Mr. Mime is shown to be adept at rock climbing. Mr. Mime is usually very rare but can be found in suburban areas. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, it is hard to tell whether Mr. Mime is either sleeping or pretending to be asleep due to its masterful pantomime skills. In Generation II, Substitute was its signature move. Prior to Generation VI and in Generation VIII, Mr. Mime and its pre-evolved form, Mime Jr., were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Filter as an Ability.",

            "description": "Scyther is a bipedal, insectoid Pok\u00e9mon . Its body is primarily green and has a thin, cream-colored section between its head, thorax, and abdomen. Female Scyther have larger abdomens than male Scyther. Its reptilian head has two narrow, triangular eyes and three blunt horns extending from its forehead. Its arms end in large, white scythes, which it uses for both hunting and fighting. Two pairs of cream-colored wings extend from its back. While these wings do allow Scyther to fly, it rarely does so. Scyther's thighs have large, upward-pointing spikes. Its feet are tall, rounded, and conical, almost extending to its thighs; each foot ends in three small, white claws on its front side.\nScyther is an adept hunter that tears at its prey with its scythes. Thanks to its green coloration, it can camouflage itself well in the grasslands and forests where it lives. Humans rarely encounter wild Scyther in these areas, however. Said to be like a ninja, Scyther can move so quickly that it cannot be followed, increasing the effectiveness of its scythes. It maintains the sharpness of its blades through battle as well as by cutting through hard objects, such as trees; it can cut down a massive tree with just a single slice, although it cannot penetrate Tarountula 's elastic threads. The Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Tracey Gets Bugged showed that wild Scyther form swarms with a single leader chosen through combat. When a challenger successfully defeats a current leader and replaces it, the defeated leader is exiled from the swarm. In Showdown at Dark City , it was shown that Scyther becomes aggressive when faced with the color red.",

            "description": "Jynx is a bipedal, humanoid Pok\u00e9mon that resembles a woman. It has a purple face, pink lips, saucer-like eyes, and long blonde hair. It wears a red gown with two gold circlets on the chest. While the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Stage Fight! showed it to possess feet, the games show only blackness under the dress, and it lacks a footprint . Despite this, it is able to learn the kicking move Triple Axel . It has white arms and five-fingered purple hands. Jynx is a female-only species with no male counterpart.\nOriginally, its face was colored black. Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 's fainting animation had it disappear leaving only its hair behind, implying that what appears to be dark-colored skin is actually just darkness.\nJynx has a language that sounds similar to human speech and includes several cry patterns. However, this language has yet to be deciphered. It prefers to communicate by using dance-like movements. There are some musicians who compose songs for Jynx to sing. These rhythmic movements often cause people to dance along with it. The Jynx in Alola are said to have wonderful precise movements. In certain parts of Galar , it has been feared and worshiped while being called the \"Queen of Ice\". The Jynx in Galar are said to have beautiful and delicate voices and a fanbase dedicated to them. Jynx are able to extend their lips to kiss its opponent. Jynx often is found in urban areas .\nJynx is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Lovely Kiss by leveling up.",

            "description": "Electabuzz is a slightly humanoid Pok\u00e9mon with a few feline traits. It has antennae with bulbous tips where its ears should be, two long tufts of fur on top of its head, small eyes, and two large fangs in its upper jaw. It is covered in yellow fur with many black stripes. There is a large, lightning bolt-shaped stripe on Electabuzz's chest, a V-shaped stripe on its forehead, one stripe on its side, a thick stripe down its back, two bands on each leg, several broken bands on each arm, and many rings around its long tail. There are three clawed toes on each of its feet, two in front and one in back, and five fingers on each hand.\nIn the dark, Electabuzz will glow light blue from the electrical charges running across its body. It is constantly leaking more electricity than it consumes. Bearing near an Electabuzz will cause a human's hair to stand on end. Electabuzz often gathered groups around tall trees to wait for the upcoming storm. During torrential thunderstorms, Electabuzz will compete to find locations likely to be struck by lightning to absorb the electric power. Electabuzz is often used as an alternative to lightning rods because it is unharmed by the absorption of electricity. It is also capable of entirely nonverbal communication via electrical currents when near another of its species. Blackouts have been known to happen when groups of Electabuzz gather to consume electricity from power plants, they often get blamed for the occurring power outages. As a result, Ground-type Pok\u00e9mon are kept around power plants to keep Electabuzz from raiding, although the blackouts are usually the fault of the electric companies, not Electabuzz. There is ongoing research on using Electabuzz to store away lightning until it is needed to be used later.\nAs demonstrated in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Showdown at Dark City , Electabuzz is sent into a rage by the color red. In battle, Electabuzz windmills its arms, apparently to add momentum to its punches. This method of battle seems ineffective, as opponents can escape in the meantime. Electabuzz typically resides near power plants and can cause blackouts in cities, though it can also be found in grasslands .",

Magmar's shoulders and thighs are yellow, and its red feet have two, clawed toes each. It has black, metal shackles around its neck and ankles. Down its back is a row of red spikes, and there is a flame at the tip of its tapering, yellow tail.\nMagmar's body temperature is nearly 2,200\u00b0 Fahrenheit (1,200\u00b0 Celsius), giving its body an orange glow. Because it hates cold places, this Pok\u00e9mon typically resides in and around active volcanoes where it is born from. This Pok\u00e9mon has even been known to spit scorching flames to establish an ideally warm environment for itself. The Magmar found in Alola are said to be sturdier than Magmar found elsewhere.\nIn battle, Magmar blows out intense flames from all over its body to intimidate its foes and incinerate its surroundings. The Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Riddle Me This has shown that extremely well-trained Magmar can block Electric-type attacks with super-heated air. However, an outmatched Magmar will quickly retreat, using its fiery camouflage and its wavering, rippling glare to blend into any present fires. As stated in the 23rd chapter of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , Magmar is very persistent and will hunt down anyone who manages to defeat it. It is able to heal its wounds and weariness by soaking in lava. Magmar has a bad habit of unintentionally burning its prey to a crisp. Its body is always constantly burning. Magmar is feared as one of the many causes of fires.",

On top of its head is a large pair of gray, spiky pincers on top of its head. In its mouth are many long, flat teeth arranged horizontally and it has triangular eyes. Capable of seeing color to some degree, Pinsir appears to be attracted to the color green. Its legs are short and thick, while its arms are long and thin. It has three claws on each hand and foot; two of its toes face forward and one backward.\nPinsir can use its pincers to crush, toss, bludgeon, or tear opponents; lift things twice its weight; and shatter logs. Captured prey is kept in place by the piercing thorns and sheer strength of Pinsir's horns and will not be released until they are torn in half. Pinsir's horns are quite flexible as depicted in the Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards where they have a wide range of motion. In addition to hunting prey, it's shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode A Sappy Ending that it enjoys tree sap. Pinsir lives deep in the temperate forests and jungles , where it burrows underground or hides in the treetops on nights cold enough to render it immobile. In Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Pinsir burrows itself into the ground to sleep during cold nights but its pincers can be seen sticking out of the ground as it slumbers. In Alola , it has a rivalry with Vikavolt and gets along with Heracross . Pinsir are known to judge each other based on their pincers.

It has a rounded muzzle with a dark brown nose, small, triangular eyes, three gray bumps running vertically down its forehead, and a pair of curved, gray horns growing from atop its head. Each of its three black tails has a tuft of fur on the end, and there is a single gray hoof on each foot. Tauros is a male-only species.\nTauros is a violent, rowdy Pok\u00e9mon that whips itself into a frenzy using its three tails. It serves as a warning to others that Tauros is about to charge with astonishing speed. Once it starts charging, it is unable to stop or change course until it hits something. Tauros are capable of smashing through large boulders when charging. It lives and travels in herds on plains and grasslands . It will lock horns with others of its kind, and the herd's protector takes pride in its battle-scarred horns.\nWhile still ferocious, Tauros are calmer in Alola than elsewhere, likely due to the region's climate. It is believed that the practice of using Tauros as Ride Pok\u00e9mon , which is done to this day, originated in Alola. In contrast, Tauros in Galar are more volatile and don't like to be ridden.\nTauros is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Raging Bull .",

            "description": "Magikarp is a piscine Pok\u00e9mon with large, heavy reddish-orange scales. It has large, vacant eyes and pink lips. Its pectoral and tail fins are white. On its back is a stiff, three-peaked yellow fin, resembling a crown; there is an identical fin on its underside. It also has long barbels . The barbels are white on a female and pale-yellow on a male. A long-lived Magikarp is able to utilize its immense splashing power to leap high enough to scale mountains. It also has a strong enough immune system to survive in the most polluted of waters. However, it is usually overlooked by Trainers because of its perceived weakness: even in the heat of battle, it will do nothing but flop around. It is believed that the ancestors of Magikarp were actually much stronger than modern Magikarp, and this led scientists to research this species.\nMagikarp is found in many bodies of water , such as lakes, rivers, and ponds. However, due to its weak swimming ability, it usually lives downstream of the water's flow. In Generation I , Splash was its signature move . It is often seen using Splash to leap out of the water, which makes it an easy target for predators such as Pidgeotto and Pidgeot . Frillish is also known to prey on Magikarp.\nIn Hoppy Town , there are at least 31 unique pattern varieties of Magikarp, with their scales coming in colors such as gray, black, white, purple, pink, violet, apricot, and brown. These patterns can be classified by groups, depending on how the Magikarp looks while it is still small; a specific pattern arises when it becomes bigger. Which patterns can be caught depend on the type of Old Rod; the better the rod, the more groups of patterns can be fished. The people in Hoppy Town train their Magikarp to jump the highest in order to compete in a series of Leagues to win prizes.",

It is mostly blue with a yellow underbelly, and it has a row of yellow spots down each side. Its mouth is very large and gaping, bearing four pointed teeth and yellow lips. It has one pair of barbel and a small white fin on each side of its face. The barbels are white on a female and blue on a male. It has small, red eyes, a three-pointed, dark blue crest on its head, and four white, spiky dorsal fins . Gyarados's tail fin is similar in structure to the crest on its head, except with a thin, white fin spread between the points.\nThe process of evolution causes a change in its brain structure that is believed to cause its violent nature. Gyarados's fangs can crush stones and its scales are harder than steel. Gyarados is feared for its fierce temper and wanton destructive tendencies since ancient times. In some regions, Gyarados is called the \"deity of destruction\" because of this. It appears in times of conflict and destroys the surrounding area. Its rampages have been known to last a month at a time. These rampages can occur even during a harsh storm. A Gyarados's rage won't stop completely until everything is destroyed. Some believed any human settlement is fated to be destroyed should a Gyarados appear. Gyarados lives in both fresh and salty waters . Both Gyarados and its Mega form have demonstrated in Pok\u00e9mon Chronicles and Pok\u00e9mon the Series that it can leap huge distances both from the water and from the ground , usually several times its own body length. However, Gyarados is rarely seen in the wild. The move Hyper Beam is often associated with Gyarados due to it being being powerful enough to instantly destroy everything it hits.",

On its back is a heavy, gray shell covered in blunt knobs.\nLapras is a gentle, helpful Pok\u00e9mon that enjoys ferrying people across bodies of water. In the past, its docility made it an easy target for hunters, and it was driven to near extinction. Recent protection efforts have seen Lapras become overabundant instead, which is now affecting the fish Pok\u00e9mon numbers in some areas. An intelligent Pok\u00e9mon, it can understand human speech. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Viva Las Lapras , Lapras has been known to travel in large pods across the seas , spanning both polar and tropical areas. To keep in touch with others of its kind, it sings enchanting melodies. Lapras usually sing when it is in a good mood. In the episode Holiday Hi-Jynx , it's shown that Lapras can develop psychic abilities such as telepathy. In Alola , Lapras is used as a Ride Pok\u00e9mon called Lapras Paddle, Alolan natives use Lapras to travel and fish for Pok\u00e9mon in the water.",

            "description": "In its natural state, Ditto is a light-purple or pink blob-like Pok\u00e9mon with vestigial facial features. It is often referred to as amorphous, but has a relatively consistent appearance in official artwork, including two small nubs on its \"head\", a few soft lumps at its base, and two pseudopod -like protrusions in place of arms. The face consists of beady eyes and a simple mouth; almost always pulled into a smile.\nDitto bears a variety of unusual and often entirely unique traits that set it apart from every other Pok\u00e9mon. It is capable of transforming into an exact replica of any physical object or living creature, including its form and abilities. Each Ditto has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to transforming; being unable to remain transformed while laughing and getting details of its transformation wrong if based on memory being apparently universal. The Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards depict Ditto being able to transform separate sections of its body into parts from multiple Pok\u00e9mon at once. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Ditto's Mysterious Mansion , as well as in the TCG and some spin-off games , it is shown that occasionally Ditto cannot change its face during transformation; a trait that has become synonymous with the species despite being incongruous with their depiction in core series games. While its transformation ability allows it to get along with almost anything, it does not get along with its own kind, which it will quickly (and generally fruitlessly) attempt to transform into. It is shown to be able to transform into humans as well; however, it cannot mimic human speech. It transforms into a rock when sleeping to avoid being attacked. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Ditto is known to sleep while still transformed into either a rock or Pok\u00e9mon. On very rare occasions, a sleeping Ditto will transform back to normal when it is relaxed.\nDitto is never far from civilization or people , and is the only Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Metal Powder and Quick Powder items. It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Imposter as an Ability . In The Indigo Disk , various Ditto Blocks can be found as objectives in Blueberry Quests throughout the Terarium , where Ditto will seemingly transform into one of the many cubes with rounded edges that make up many of the structures of the Terarium. Despite being milestones for the player to obtain, and not actually obtainable themselves, they can still be Shiny . [3]",

It is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that is easily influenced by its environment. This allows it to adapt to a variety of habitats by evolving . Eevee can potentially evolve into eight different Evolutions . Eevee can also start to adopt the face of the Trainer that owns it. Eevee's genes are believed to have the key to solving the mysteries of Pok\u00e9mon Evolution. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Eevee is believed to dream about which form it will evolve into.

Vaporeon's body is light blue with a dark blue marking around its head and a spiky ridge down its spine. It has black eyes and a tiny black nose. There is a white fin encircling its neck and three fins with cream-colored webbing on its head. Two of these fins are on either side of its head, similar to ears; and one is directly on top of its head, resembling a dorsal fin . Vaporeon is a quadruped with three small toes on each foot and dark blue paw pads on the hind feet. Its split tail fin has been mistaken for a mermaid's in the past and is believed to be the origin of mermaid folklore. It can detect moisture with its fins, which vibrate when sensing incoming rain.\nVaporeon is mostly found in urban settings under the ownership of a Trainer . It is rarely seen in the wild, but it prefers clean freshwater lakes and shores. It has developed gills to become better suited to an aquatic lifestyle, and its cell composition's similarity to water allows it to melt into the water. This ability enables Vaporeon to remain camouflaged while swimming, hiding itself from enemies and allowing it to ambush its prey: fish Pok\u00e9mon.",

            "description": "Jolteon is a quadrupedal, mammalian Pok\u00e9mon . It is covered in yellow fur with a spiky fringe around its tail and a white ruff around its neck. Its ears are large and pointed with black interiors, and its eyes and small nose are black. It has slender legs and small paws, each with three toes and a pink paw-pad.\nJolteon creates electricity using an organ in its lungs, which causes crackling noises as it exhales. It can also generate low-level electricity in its cells, which is amplified by the negative ions it gathers and generates in its fur, allowing it to discharge 10,000-volt lightning bolts. Jolteon's prickly fur is made of electrically charged needles, which create a sparking noise as it moves. It is capable of launching its fur at enemies when agitated or startled; the charge is so powerful that it can remain on the shed fur for a long time. This Pok\u00e9mon is most often found in cities and towns under the ownership of Trainers . However, its high-strung nature and tendency toward mood swings can make it difficult to train. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , the crackling sound of electricity can be heard while Jolteon exhales during its slumber. [1]",

            "description": "Flareon is a mammalian , quadrupedal Pok\u00e9mon covered in short, reddish-orange fur. It has long ears with black interiors, dark eyes, and a small black nose. There are three small toes and a yellow paw pad on each foot. Fluffy yellow fur forms a small tuft on its head, as well as its bushy tail and a mane around its chest and neck.\nFlareon's body temperature is caused by its internal flame sac, and rises when it is excited. If its body gets too hot, it will fluff out the fur on its collar to cool down. Flareon stores and heats inhaled air in its flame sac, and then exhales it as fire with temperatures of around 3,100\u00a0\u00b0F (1,700\u00a0\u00b0C). Flareon's average body temperature is around 1,300-1,500\u00a0\u00b0F (700-800\u00a0\u00b0C), but it can reach 1,700\u00a0\u00b0F (900\u00a0\u00b0C). It is an omnivore that roasts either Berries or prey before consumption. Flareon has a curious personality, and is mostly found in populated areas , rarely seen in the wilderness. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , it is believed that Flareon is regulating its body temperature while sleeping. Due its fur releasing heat to help cool it down, Flareon is able to sleep comfortably.",

It has a pink, polyhedral head that ends in a blue beak and has hexagonal eyes, and it has a pink polyhedral body with a blue front, blue triangular prism feet, and a blue rectangular prism tail. In 3D games, such as Pok\u00e9mon Stadium , it can open its beak and can detach its limbs and head from its torso. According to its Pok\u00e9dex entries , it has copy protection built into its code, preventing duplication through electronic means. It was created in 1995 by Silph Co. , but documents at Silph Co. claim it was created at the Pok\u00e9mon Lab on Cinnabar Island using the state-of-the-art technology of its time. Because it was created decades ago, many of its parts have since become obsolete. It was the first artificial Pok\u00e9mon to have ever been created through computer programming. In ancient Hisui , people were confused about Porygon and its evolutions due to them arriving through space-time distortions and being the product of far more advanced technology than what was available at the time.\nDue to its man-made origins, Porygon does not need to breathe or eat, though it can still accept food if given. It has the ability to convert its body into digital data, allowing it to travel through cyberspace. Recently, it has become more helpful inside cyberspace by searching for any suspicious data that exists. Some believed Porygon has the power to potentially travel in space despite the species not displaying that ability yet. Because it is man-made, it is generally found in computers or in labs and other buildings where people work.\nPorygon and its evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Conversion and Conversion 2 .

If attacked or threatened, it quickly withdraws into its hard shell.\nOmanyte is considered extinct, although it can be revived from Fossils . Its fossils have been excavated in areas that were once oceans long ago. Omanyte regulated its buoyancy by storing and releasing air within its shell and controlled direction by twisting its tentacles. While Omanyte fed on plankton , it was preyed on by Archeops and Carracosta . Omanyte can now be found in the wild due to being released by people or escaping after being restored to life, causing this species to become a problem.",

Its eyes have yellow sclerae and vertically-slit pupils. It has an oval mouth with a four-sectioned, fang-like beak .\nIt is believed that Omastar's extinction was a consequence of the increasingly heavy weight of its shell that affected its mobility, including its hunting. Omastar swam the seas in search of prey, including prehistoric Shellder . It attacks only when prey comes near its tentacles. Omastar uses its tentacles to ensnare its prey before biting down with the deadly force of its beak. Its fangs are powerful enough to crush through rocks. With the shell broken, it would suck out the contents. Omastar was in turn preyed upon by Carracosta . Omastar is thought to be a distant ancestor to Octillery .",

It has a flat, half-circular head with a point on each side and two small eyes on the front. It is mostly brown, except for its light gray chest and abdomen. There is a ridge down its back with three flat spines on either side and it has a flat, pointed tail. Instead of hands, its forearms have large, sharp, gray scythes. Its thin legs are brown lead to small feet with two large gray claws.\nBefore it went extinct, Kabutops was in the process of evolving into a land dweller as evident by changes in its gills and legs. This change is thought to be due to its prey moving onto land as well. In its ocean home Kabutops could tuck up its limbs to help it swim extremely fast, up to roughly 29 knots. It used its sharp scythes to slice enemies and drink their internal fluids. Any leftovers left behind by Kabutops are consumed by other Pok\u00e9mon. It is unknown what led to Kabutops's extinction.",

            "description": "Aerodactyl is a reptilian , bipedal prehistoric Pok\u00e9mon that resembles a pterosaur with several draconic features. It has small sharply pointed ears, narrow dark green eyes, a ridged snout, a gaping mouth, and a strong lower jaw full of serrated fangs. Its body is covered in light blue-gray skin and it has large, violet membranous wings. The clawed hands at the end of each wing allow it to grasp objects. There is a hump-like ridge with a spike on its back, and it has a strong tail with an arrow-shaped tip. Its talon-like feet have two toes in front and one in the back, and are capable of scooping up and tightly clutching its prey in flight.\nAerodactyl's serrated saw-like fangs and ferocious attitude were very imposing in its time. Its fangs can rip out throats and tear through the skin of any Pok\u00e9mon to pieces, even Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon. By spreading its wings, Aerodactyl is believed to have flown by gliding through the skies, freely letting out its high-pitched cries. However, it is slow to walk on land. It liked to nest in the mountains , where it enjoyed both safety and seclusion. Aerodactyl lived in prehistoric times, and was theorized to become extinct thanks to a giant meteor impact. It was restored in modern times using genetic material extracted from amber; some casualties occurred during these attempts. Even still, this restoration is not considered perfect.",

Its body is composed of mostly its belly, as its limbs are comparatively small. Its head is large with small, pointed ears, and two pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw. It has round feet, which both have three claws and a circular brown paw pad, and short arms with five claws on each hand. Snorlax's bulk makes it the heaviest Normal type.\nSnorlax is often found in mountains and forests . It wakes up only to eat, requiring 900\u00a0lbs. (400\u00a0kg) of food per day before returning to its slumber, although it can also eat while it is resting. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects. It can even handle thorny plants or Muk 's poison. Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pok\u00e9mon bounce on its large stomach. Despite its apparent laziness, however, Snorlax can exhibit tremendous power when prompted. Snorlax is known to appear without warning in villages and steal their food supplies, such as rice granaries, which has long been considered a disaster whenever it happens. Professor Neroli does research on Snorlax, particularly on their ability to attract Pok\u00e9mon around them to sleep. A lot of Pok\u00e9mon tend to gather around Snorlax to sleep near it or on it.\nSnorlax is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move Pulverizing Pancake .",

According to legend, it appears before doomed travelers lost in icy regions. As seen in Freeze Frame , Articuno sometimes aids travelers and guides them to safety.

Additionally, its wings are also shrouded in fiery plumage. It has a long, thin neck, a pointed, brown beak, and small, triangular eyes. Its thin, brown legs have anisodactyl feet, with three forward-facing digits and one facing backward.\nMoltres sheds embers with every flap of its wings, creating a brilliant flash of flames. By dipping itself into the magma of an active volcano, this Pok\u00e9mon can heal itself. It migrates from the south with the coming of spring, and is said to bring an early springtime to cold lands. There have been stories of Moltres using its wings to assist those lost in the mountains. Moltres is rarely seen . Moltres loves Moltres Treats made by Snacksworth , who once encountered it in the past.\nShadow Moltres is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Shadow Fire . Also, in Generation II , Sky Attack was its signature move, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .",

            "description": "Dratini is a reptilian Pok\u00e9mon with a blue serpentine body and a white underside. It has white, three-pronged fins on the sides of its head and a white bump on its forehead, which is its horn growing. Above its round, white snout are oval, purple eyes.\nDratini's life energy is constantly building so it is always growing, and can reach lengths of over six feet (2 meters). As it grows, it sheds its skin regularly; it hides behind a rapid waterfall during the process to protect itself, since the new skin is soft in texture. The shed skin can be tanned and used to create luxury boots. Dratini has been referred as the \"Mirage Pok\u00e9mon\", because its existence was originally thought to be nothing more than a myth. Dratini was first discovered by a fisherman who spent 10 hours attempting to capture it. A small colony has also been found underwater, further confirming its existence. Dratini live near or in bodies of water with a rapid flow, such as the pools at the bottom of waterfalls. It lives a quiet life underwater, eating any food that sinks down to the bottom.\nAs mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Dratini's sleeping habits used to be a mystery due to how rare it was. However, in recent years, Dratini's sleep styles have been discovered and well documented. This is due to trainers who have obtained Dratini and observed its sleeping habits. The four different sleep styles discovered are called Coiled Sleep , Wriggly Sleep , Uncoiled Sleep , and Atop-Belly Sleep .\nIn Generation II , Dratini and its evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Outrage , but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .",

It has a rounded snout, oval purple eyes, and a small, white horn on its forehead. On each side of its head is a small, stylized wing, which is white and curves into a swirl at the base. Three blue, crystal orbs adorn its body: one on its neck and two on its tail.\nDragonair emits a gentle aura that gives it a mystical appearance. As seen in Pikachu's Rescue Adventure , it can make its wings grow larger in order to fly, but otherwise moves through the air unaided. Dragonair hosts a large amount of energy within its body, which it can discharge through the crystals on its neck and tail. This causes its body to brighten and give off a different aura that changes the weather in its vicinity. As a result, Dragonair has been referred as a \"divine Pok\u00e9mon\" since ancient times by agricultural peoples. Dragonair is a rare Pok\u00e9mon that inhabits pristine seas and lakes . The lakes Dragonair lives in are usually filled with offerings from people in gratitude. It is said that a person who sees a Dragonair at the start of a year will be healthy for the whole year. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Dragonair is known to channel power and change the weather even while it sleeps.

            "description": "Dragonite is a draconic , bipedal reptilian Pok\u00e9mon with light orange skin. It has large, grayish-green eyes and a round snout with small nostrils. A pair of long, thin antennae sprout from the top of its head with a small horn set between them. Its striated underbelly is cream-colored and extends from its neck to the tip of its long, tapering tail. It has thick arms and legs ending in three claws each. The leg joints are well defined, while its arms have a smooth, rounded appearance. Dragonite's wings are small relative to its body with teal wing membranes.\nDespite its bulky build, Dragonite is capable of flying faster than the speed of sound, being able to circle the globe in sixteen hours. A kindhearted Pok\u00e9mon with human-like intelligence, Dragonite shows signs of altruism: it is said to save humans from drowning and lead lost or foundering ships to safety. As demonstrated in Great Bowls of Fire! , however, it will go on an uncontrollable, destructive rampage if its environment is threatened. Dragonite will usually calm down and be satisfied after smashing down anything that has angered it to smithereens. It is known to engage in fierce battles with Kingdra whenever they meet. Dragonite has been referred to as the \"sea guardian\" and the \"Sea Incarnate\"; as such, there are many ships with figureheads decorated with Dragonite's look. Drayden stated in Thrash of the Titans! that Dragonite's power is capable of affecting the weather. In Fiore , Dragonite used by Pok\u00e9mon Rangers to travel to different areas in the region, this flying service is called the Dragonite Bus .\nDragonite is very rare in the wild, typically living near the sea . Some claim that there is an island somewhere in the ocean that only Dragonite inhabit. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Dragonite is known to sleep soundly while displaying its belly. This rare sight is said to be an exhausted Dragonite resting after flying over the vast seas.\nIn Generation II , Dragonite and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Outrage , but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .",

            "description": "Mewtwo is an artificial Pok\u00e9mon . It is a bipedal, humanoid Pok\u00e9mon with some feline features. Its body is primarily gray with a long, purple tail and a large purple underbelly. On top of its head are two short, blunt horns, and it has purple eyes. A tube extends from the back of its skull to the top of its spine, bypassing its neck. It has a defined chest and shoulders, which resemble a breastplate. The three digits on each hand and foot have spherical tips. Its tail is thick at the base but thins before ending in a small bulb.\nAccording to journals found in Kanto 's Pok\u00e9mon Mansion , after discovering the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Mew and gathering some of its DNA, Mr. Fuji used it in his mansion to create Mewtwo, a modified clone of Mew with the goal to making it the most powerful Pok\u00e9mon of all. It was held and studied in the mansion where horrific gene-splicing experiments were made making the Pok\u00e9mon vicious and extremely powerful. It eventually broke free and fled the Mansion, destroying it in the process. It is widely known as one of the most powerful Pok\u00e9mon in existence and is said to have the most savage heart among all Pok\u00e9mon, lacking compassion and striking fear into its enemy with cold, glowing eyes . Mewtwo conserves energy by remaining motionless in order to unleash its full power in battle. Because it was engineered to be the ultimate opponent in battle, it can only think of defeating its foes. Though rarely seen in the wild, it is said to be resting in a dark cave somewhere.\nIn Mewtwo Strikes Back , a Mewtwo exemplified its vicious characteristics. It was shown to be capable of levitation, telepathy, mind control, memory erasure, teleporting others to another location, and the creation of powerful storms. However, it was later shown to be caring, protective, and even altruistic. Another Mewtwo in Genesect and the Legend Awakened also shared its aversion to contact with others but was much less belligerent. As shown in POK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu , Mewtwo can also transfer a human 's soul into a Pok\u00e9mon's body provided that said Pok\u00e9mon is in a crazed state, causing this person to gain control of the Pok\u00e9mon's body and abilities. It possesses a rivalry with Mew . As seen in Genesect and the Legend Awakened , Mewtwo can breathe in outer space. In the Pok\u00e9mon Adventures manga, it's revealed Mewtwo 's creation wasn't possible with the amount of Mew's cells gathered, so to complete it, human cells were used instead, specifically from the Team Rocket scientist Blaine . Due to Blaine possessing some of Mewtwo's cells as well, the two became linked, which granted Blaine to ability to track its whereabouts at the cost of slowly taking his life.\nMewtwo is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Psystrike .\nA unique variant of Mewtwo, called Shadow Mewtwo , is very similar to standard Mewtwo, but with dark gray skin, a dark gray tail with a yellowish orange tip, and a shard of Shadow Synergy Stone coming out of its shoulder. In the past, Anne was almost possessed by a Shadow Synergy Stone but was saved by Mewtwo, whom the Shadow Synergy Stone took control of and merged with instead. Under the stone's influence, Shadow Mewtwo travelled around Ferrum , draining Gaia Power from other normal Synergy Stones , which continuously increases its power.",

            "description": "Mew is a pink, bipedal Pok\u00e9mon with mammalian features. It has a rounded, wide snout; triangular ears; and large, blue eyes. It has short arms with three-fingered paws and large hind paws with oval markings on the soles. Its tail is long and thin with an ovoid tip. Its fur is so fine and thin, it can only be seen under a microscope.\nMew has shown a playful, childish personality, showing signs of high intelligence, curiosity, shyness, playfulness, and even selflessness. It is said to have the DNA of every single Pok\u00e9mon contained within its body. This causes many scientists to theorize that Mew is the ancestor of all Pok\u00e9mon . It is an incredibly adaptable species, capable of levitation and teleportation. It can use almost all known moves , regardless of their types . It has also shown the rare power to transform into all known Pok\u00e9mon . It is capable of making itself invisible at will, so it entirely avoids notice even if it approaches people. As seen on several occasions, it has the ability to create an orb of energy around itself for protection, which can come in many colors, such as green, yellow, and pink.\nAccording to journals found in Kanto 's Pok\u00e9mon Mansion , Mr. Fuji is the one who discovered Mew deep in the jungle and coined its name. With other scientists, he managed to gather some of Mew's DNA and used it in his mansion to create a modified clone of it, aiming it to be the most powerful Pok\u00e9mon of all, which resulted in the birth of the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon Mewtwo . Since Mew can make itself invisible, very few people have seen it , leading some scientists to declare it extinct and most to assume it to be nothing, but a mirage. However, sightings of it are still being reported to this day, confirming its existence. Even though it's rarely seen, it will willingly show itself to a person who is pure of heart and has a strong desire to see it.\nAccording to the Pok\u00e9mon the Series -related radio drama, The Birth of Mewtwo , Mew was discovered by Jessie 's mother, Miyamoto , who registered its cry in a forest 20 years before the events of the series. It was worshiped for its protection by ancient people who created a song in its honor and believed it appeared once a year with the rising sun. It wasn't rediscovered until 18 years after Miyamoto met Mew by sunrise on the peak of a high mountain. As depicted in the episode In the Palms of our Hands! it is capable of splitting itself up and transforming into more than one Pok\u00e9mon at the same time. It was also shown to possess a strong rivalry with its clone, Mewtwo in Mewtwo Strikes Back .\nMew is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move Genesis Supernova .",

The leaf is also used to sense temperature and humidity. Chikorita actively seeks out and enjoys the sun's warmth. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Chikorita uses the leaf to search for the coziest place to sleep in. On occasion, Chikorita can be seen relaxing as it sleeps due to finding a great spot. Chikorita can be found in grasslands . However, due to its status as a first partner Pok\u00e9mon, a wild Chikorita is hard to come by and it is generally found under the ownership of Trainers . It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy . Chikorita has a docile nature.",

Each foot has a single, light gray nail. Sprouting from its forehead is a green leaf that curves back over its head and around its neck are a series of tightly curled leaves. Inside the leaves are small tree shoots.\nThe aroma wafting from the leaves around its neck has a spicy scent and has various beneficial effects on those who inhale it. The fragrance has a combination of energizing, stimulating, and healing effects. Bayleef can be rarely found in grasslands . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , any Pok\u00e9mon sleeping near Bayleaf will feel invigorated. [1]",

It has a long neck; yellow eyes; a short, blunt snout; and two stamen -like antennae on top of its snout. The antennae are shorter on a female than on a male. Encircling Meganium's neck are large, pink flower petals with a yellow central pattern and white edges. It has three claws on each foot and a stubby tail.\nMeganium's petals release an aroma that calms aggressive feelings and its breath has the power to revive dead grass and plants. Its soothing, regenerative powers can even affect those who stand nearby. Meganium tends to be very docile and is portrayed as a peacemaker in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Odd Pok\u00e9mon Out! . It can rarely be found living in grasslands . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , many Pok\u00e9mon tend to sleep peacefully side-by-side with Meganium. The reason is fragrance given off by Meganium's flower sooths and calms emotions of any Pok\u00e9mon fighting near it.\nA special Meganium is worshiped in Lental for being one of the seven guardian Illumina Pok\u00e9mon . It resides in the Florio Island Illumina Spot .",

Its eyes are usually seen closed, and it has a long, thin snout. Its arms are short, but its legs are slightly more developed and have a single nail on each foot. On its back are four red circles that can erupt into flames. When the flames are burning, its back has the appearance of being covered in spines.\nCyndaquil is capable of defending itself using these flames, and the fire grows more powerful as it becomes angry or defensive. Cyndaquil's firepower is described as being tremendously powerful. However, if it is tired, the flames are not able to burn properly. It is usually timid by nature and often curls into a ball when intimidated. Due to this, Cyndaquil prefers staying hunched over. Though rare in the wild, it can be found living on grasslands . It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Cyndaquil is known to usually sleep curled up. On rare occasions, it will spout flames from its back while sleeping.",

            "description": "Quilava is a quadrupedal Pok\u00e9mon with a long and slender body. The top half of its body is a dark blue-green, while its underside is cream-colored. It has triangular ears with dark red interiors, a rounded snout, and triangular red eyes. Each of its paws has three toes. It has five red spots on its body that can project flames: two arranged vertically on its forehead and three lined up horizontally on its rear.\nBefore a battle, Quilava turns its back so its flames face its opponent. It battles using these intense flames in combination with gusts of superheated air. Its own fur is non-flammable, which protects it from other fire attacks. Quilava tends to be rare in the wild, but can sometimes be found living on grasslands . When exposed to the mysterious energy of Mount Coronet in Hisui , Quilava's evolution is altered, gaining it the Ghost type as it becomes Hisuian Typhlosion . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Quilava's flames on its back blaze brightly while it sleeps. [1]",

Most of its body is cream-colored, but its back and the top of its head are a dark green-blue. It has a short, rounded snout and small, triangular eyes and ears. When its mouth is open, its sharp canine teeth and thick tongue are visible. Each of its paws has five digits and there is a coarse, spiky fringe of fur along its rear. Across the back of its neck, several red spots can produce fire.\nTyphlosion is capable of making anything go up in flames when angered and creating explosions by rubbing its fur together. The heat it generates when ready for battle creates a shimmering haze that can also be used to hide itself. When fully enraged, anything Typhlosion touches instantly goes up in flames. Though it is rare in the wild, it can be found living on grasslands . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Typhlosion is known to toss and turn while sleeping. It is recommended to avoid a sleeping Typhlosion due to it unleashing blasts fires from its back by accident.",

Down its back is a row of three red spines with a small, red ridge on either side. The tip of its tail has a single red spine as well.\nTotodile tends to be both playful and rough by nature and has a habit of biting anything it sees, including its Trainer . Despite its size, Totodile's jaws are capable of crushing anything, so it sometimes causes serious injuries. Turning one's back on Totodile is considered to be a bad idea as it can bite without warning. Totodile are scarce in the wild, though it can be found around bodies of water like rivers, ponds, and lakes . It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy . As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Totodile and its evolutions are known to sleep with one eye open and rest only half of its brain at a time \u2014 a practice known as unihemispheric sleep . This practice is hypothesized to be a defense mechanism against enemy attacks.",

Its eyes are red with black markings around them. There are three clusters of red spikes on its body: one with three points on top of its head, one with two points between its shoulders, and a diamond-shaped one near the tip of its tail. While most of its body is blue, its lower jaw is yellow and there is an asymmetrical, yellow-and-blue pattern around its chest that resembles a spotted animal skin.\nAlthough Croconaw is described as always having forty-eight fangs lining its mouth, only six are discernible. The tips of its teeth are slanted backward similar to a barbed fish hook; this makes them impossible to remove once embedded in something. Once Croconaw has bitten down onto something, it will not let go until it loses its teeth; any missing teeth will quickly grow back. Croconaw can rarely be found near water . As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Croconaw and its evolutionary relatives are known to sleep with one eye open and rest only half of its brain at a time \u2014 a practice known as unihemispheric sleep . During sleep, as one half of Croconaw's brain rests, the eye on the same side opens. This allows Croconaw to watch for enemy attacks while it sleeps.",

Three teeth are visible when its jaws are closed: two in its lower jaw and one in its upper. Its eyes are red with black markings around them and ridges above them and its lower jaw is yellow. There are three red spines on its body, each with three points: one on top of its head, one between its shoulders, and one near the tip of its tail. There are also several groups of large, rectangular scales on its arms, knees, tail, and waist. Its back is slightly hunched with ridges behind the shoulders and hips. On its lower body is a yellow, V-shaped marking that extends up to its thighs; there is a thin line through the center of the marking. Its arms have five clawed fingers each, and its feet three clawed toes.\nFeraligatr opens its powerful jaws to intimidate its foes and viciously shakes its head once it clamps down on foes or prey. Because it has difficulty supporting its weight out of the water, it has been known to move on all fours. However, when hunting or fighting, it is agile and fast, due to its powerful hind legs. Feraligatr can rarely be found living near the water's edge . As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Feraligatr and its pre-evolutions are known to sleep with one eye open and rest only half of its brain at a time \u2014 a practice known as unihemispheric sleep . As Feraligatr sleeps, it constantly keeps watch on its surroundings; it will immediately charge towards threats should it sense any.",

On its belly is a white ring and there are dark brown stripes around its tail.\nSentret has a cautious, timid nature and can often be seen standing on its tail to scout its surroundings. It will only sleep if there is another Sentret keeping watch and will be too frightened to sleep if separated from its pack. When it senses danger, it warns others by screeching and thumping its tail on the ground. Sentret can most commonly be found in temperate grasslands .",

The back of its head and neck are also dark brown; this marking extends to below its arms where the first ring is formed. It has cream-colored tips on its ears, two brown, whisker-like markings on each cheek, and round, black eyes. Its four limbs are stubby; the forepaws are brown and the hind paws are cream-colored. Furret is capable of standing on its hind legs but prefers to move on all fours. Its body and tail are so similar in structure that it is impossible to tell where its tail begins.\nDespite its short limbs, Furret is very quick and agile. This allows Furret to escape even when in the arms of a human. Its speed allows it to catch prey such as Rattata . It tends to burrow under the ground of meadows and other temperate grasslands . Its narrow burrows are well-suited for its slim body and are very difficult for other Pok\u00e9mon to enter. The burrows also become more maze-like deeper inside, which makes it even harder to find Furret's nest. A mother Furret curls itself around its offspring to help them sleep. Once the offspring are older, the mother Furret will take them outside to prepare them for independence. In Lental , Mightyena is a natural predator of Furret.",

            "description": "Hoothoot is an avian Pok\u00e9mon that resembles an owl with a round body. Most of its feathers are brown, but its belly is cream-colored. It has large, red eyes; a small, pinkish beak; stubby wings; and a fan-like tail with three feathers. Encircling its eyes are black rings; the lower rims of each ring have three protrusions that resemble the teeth on a gear, while the upper rims have extensions that resemble the hands of a clock. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series episode Finding a Legend! , Hoothoot's feathers can grow to be shaggy, and the protrusions on its head droop. It has two pinkish feet, each with five-clawed toes. However, it will typically only stand on one foot at a time and alternates between the two at speeds too difficult to track with the naked eye.\nHoothoot begins crying at the same time every day and always tilts its head in the same rhythm. This ability is due to a special internal organ that senses the world's rotation, allowing it to keep track of time. As a result, Hoothoot was once considered a divine messenger sent to tell the time. Some countries see Hoothoot as a deity of wisdom. Historically, people raised Hoothoot to serve as clocks \u2014 a practice still done by some Trainers today. Hoothoot is most commonly found nesting in trees in temperate and boreal forests . Hoothoot is nocturnal , and during the day, it sleeps in holes carved into tree trunks. Hoothoot preys on Grubbin .",

It has red eyes with black rings around them and a second, cream-colored ring around the first. Above its eyes are bushy, cream-colored feather \"horns\" that resemble large eyebrows. Its small beak and talons are pinkish, and its feet are cream-colored with three toes facing forward and one backward. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Throwing in the Noctowl , an elderly Noctowl can grow a small beard.\nNoctowl is a nocturnal Pok\u00e9mon that is called \"the emperor of dark nights\" by some. It has exceptional eyes that concentrate the faintest light and give it night vision, supple wings capable of silent flight, and it can twist its head at a 180-degree angle to increase its intellect. Its superior senses and intellect allow it to catch prey without fail in the darkness. It can also turn its head upside down, which signals that it is troubled by something. If disturbed in this state, it will peck at the offender. Noctowl is most commonly found nesting in trees in temperate and boreal forests .\nIn Kitakami , Noctowl is used for the region's Flying Taxi service.",

The antennae are shorter on the female than on the male. It has six black legs with white hands that resemble boxing gloves .\nLedyba is a social Pok\u00e9mon that is active in large groups. If left alone, it becomes timid and afraid to move. It is also very sensitive to cold, so it forms clusters with other Ledyba for warmth. An aromatic fluid is secreted from its feet and leg joints, which it uses for communication. The fluid indicates its location and conveys emotion; it will smell sour if Ledyba is angry. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode [{EP128|The Whistle Stop]] , Ledyba is shown to serve a role in pollinating fruit-producing plants and is usually instructed to do so by means of a special whistle. However, like most Pok\u00e9mon, it will also respond to regular vocal commands. Ledyba builds its nest on leaves in temperate forests and jungles and joins with other Ledyba to protect its home when needed.

It has three pairs of yellow legs, each with a black band around the middle.\nSpinarak is a nocturnal Pok\u00e9mon that lives in temperate and tropical forests . It spins webs that are strong enough to withstand having stones set on them and act as nets for fishermen. A patient hunter can wait for days for prey to become ensnared in its web. It senses what kind of prey has been caught by the vibrations in the web and its preferred prey is Cutiefly . Once its prey is captured, a motionless Spinarak will wait until darkness falls. Its poison is not very strong but is potent enough to weaken caught prey. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Hassle in the Castle , silk produced by a Spinarak can be used for facial treatments, as well as patching up skin wounds.\nSpinarak and its evolved form, Ariados , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Toxic Thread .

Around its abdomen are two black stripes and there are two black spots and a yellow spinneret on its rear. The spots and spinneret together form a pattern similar to a face. Ariados can produce thread from both its spinneret and its mouth. It has four yellow legs with two purple bands each; on its back are yellow structures similar to its legs with a single purple stripe each. Its feet are tipped with tiny hooks that allow it to climb ceilings and vertical walls.\nAriados makes its nest in the depths of temperate and tropical forests and leaves after dark to hunt prey. Ariados never rest in a specific place while hunting. While Ariados wanders in search of prey, it spins a single thread from its rear that leads back to its nest. When prey is captured, it is wrapped in thread and then attacked by fangs. Ariados then drinks the victim's bodily fluids at leisure. Sometimes, it will instead release prey with only a single thread attached. The thread is then followed to both the caught prey and its friends.\nAriados and its pre-evolved form, Spinarak , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Toxic Thread .

It has long, pointed ears, yellow eyes with red pupils, and a small mouth that usually has its teeth bared. On its body are two pairs of wings: an upper pair that is slightly larger and a lower pair that developed from its hind legs. Both pairs have green-blue membranes, but the lower pair's membranes are only visible from the back. The upper wings have two claw-like fingers near the middle. On the bottom of its body are what appear to be a pair of stubby feet or tufts of fur.\nCrobat is capable of flying long distances by alternating between its two sets of wings. The extra set of wings has also improved its flight speed without sacrificing its ability to fly silently. It can also travel through cramped caves without ever slowing. The combination of silent flight and sharp fangs allows it to bite down on prey without being noticed and drain their blood. If unable to consume blood, it becomes lethargic and unable to fly. Due to its lack of legs, it is clumsy on the ground and only able to crawl around with its wings. Crobat is rarely found in the wild, though it is typically found in caves or on tree branches, where it hangs upside-down by its rear wings. It is a nocturnal Pok\u00e9mon.",

The orbs on its antennae can glow and light up from the electric current, which Chinchou uses to lure prey. It also flashes its light to communicate with others of its kind and claim territory. By discharging positive and negative electricity from the antennae, it can both defend itself and stun its prey. Chinchou lives on dark ocean floors , rarely ever coming up to the surface.

The lower half of its tailfin is yellow and has jagged edges. On its back is a Y-shaped antenna with a spherical orb at each tip; this antenna is a modification of its dorsal fin.\nInside its orbs are bacteria that produce light by absorbing Lanturn's bodily fluids. It lures prey using the glow, then blinds them by using an intense flash before it swallows them whole. The flash it creates is visible on the surface from a depth of over three miles (five kilometers). This has earned it the nickname The Deep-Sea Star . Lanturn competes with Lumineon when catching its prey Starmie . Frillish and Sharpedo are natural predators of Lanturn. Lanturn inhabits the depths of the ocean .",

Pichu's pink cheek pouches can store small amounts of electricity, and its tiny nose looks like a dot. Pichu is classified as a quadruped, but it can walk easily on its hind legs.\nPichu is a social Pok\u00e9mon known for its playful and mischievous demeanor. It is usually found in groups and often touch tails with other Pichu as a show of courage, creating a shower of sparks that can make them cry. It is inept at storing electricity and may discharge if amused, startled, or subjected to shock. However, it cannot discharge without being shocked itself. Charging up is more easily done on days of dryness or with thunderclouds. The crackling of static electricity generated by Pichu is audible. It can zap an adult human but will surprise itself if it does. Pichu primarily lives in the forest , though it has also been depicted to thrive in urban areas. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Pichu is known to discharge uncontrollable electricity while sleeping. This is due to Pichu being unable to store electricity properly. The crackle sound of static electricity can be heard while Pichu sleeps.\nPichu and its evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Volt Tackle .",

Cleffa has two small black eyes and a small mouth, and it appears to have a small, permanent blush on its cheeks. It possesses stubby arms and legs, which have no defined digits and come to a point. It has a curl on its forehead and a curled-up tail.\nCleffa lives in mountainous regions , typically found at meteor impact sites. Sightings of Cleffa become more likely during nights illuminated by shooting stars, where they dance the night away; this dance is said to bring good fortune to any who witness it. They quench their thirst the next morning by drinking dew. It is fascinated by anything resembling stars and meteors, such as Minior . Because of this, as well as its own star-shaped silhouette, Cleffa is commonly believed to have arrived on a shooting star. The Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Clefairy Tales showed that its evolved forms (and therefore Cleffa itself) are actually extraterrestrial Pok\u00e9mon . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Cleffa is known to sway its body similar to a rocking craddle while sleeping. The way it moves while sleeping resembles a twinking star in the night.\nPrior to Generation V , Cleffa and its evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Magic Guard as an Ability .",

            "description": "Igglybuff is a small, bipedal balloon -like Pok\u00e9mon that is completely pink. Its body can turn deep pink when the temperature increases, or when it sings continuously. It has a rounded tuft of hair on top of its head, a small swirl-like pattern on its forehead, and red eyes. Igglybuff has small, stubby limbs, and is usually seen levitating in the air. Rather than walking, this small Pok\u00e9mon bounces like a ball to move around, as its body is extremely soft and elastic \u2014 although it may not be able to stop if it does this. As Igglybuff moves, it secretes sweat with a sweet fragrance, which calms the emotions of its foes.\nAlthough it has singing abilities, Igglybuff is not able to sing for long periods due to its underdeveloped vocal cords. It often gets a sore throat from singing too frequently. When Igglybuff gets praised, its singing slowly becomes better and better. Igglybuff tend to live in the grasslands close by freshwater streams. It uses water from the streams to gargle in its sore throat. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Igglybuff is known to bounce around while sleeping. On rare occasions, Igglybuff practices its singing as it dreams.",

That shell has a white base color, and rounded, mostly unfilled shapes (with thick borders that are either red or blue) dot the shell on all sides. Sticking out of its shell, Togepi has stubby, rounded cone arms and round feet with two toes each. Togepi has thin, black, oval eyes with thin, black arcs on their outer sides. Its head has five round-tipped, conical spikes that seem to form a crown. It also has semi-oval, brown pads on the soles of its feet.\nThe Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Case of the K-9 Caper! showed that it can retract into its shell, which it usually does to sleep, and as mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Togepi is known to roll around in its shell while sleeping. . It is able to siphon the positive energy of others, storing that happiness in its shell, and then release it to those in need of it. Early TCG cards state that Togepi is able to release poison from the spikes on its head, which it uses to chase away enemies. It has a very joyful nature. As a result, it is said that it shares its joy with those who take care of it. Because of its disposition, Togepi is seen as a sign of good luck, especially if a Trainer is capable of getting a sleeping Togepi to stand. Togepi's innocent smile is said to calm the soul. It is also shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Diamond and Pearl episode Where No Togepi Has Gone Before! that Togepi can act very maliciously at times, causing havoc and bad luck to its enemies. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode A Togepi Mirage! , it is shown that, when necessary, Togepi can fly or levitate despite lacking wings. Togepi are born within the Togepi Paradise , and appear to humans to spread kindness \u2013 it is rare in the wild, but can most commonly be found in forests . After its mission of spreading kindness is complete, it will eventually return to the Togepi Paradise.",

Whenever it spots a pure-hearted person, it tends to go to that person and shower them with happiness and glowing down called \"joy dust\". To share its happiness, it is said to fly around the world seeking these people. If it is not with kind people, however, it becomes dispirited and loses energy. Togetic is rare in the wild, but can sometimes be found living within the forests . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Togetic is known to occasionally sleep while floating and steadily flapping its wings. It is believed that a mysterious power is keeping Togetic in the air.",

Natu has a red crest on the top of its head, and its three-toed feet and three tail feathers are red as well. Natu also has almond-shaped eyes and a yellow beak.\nNatu can be found near ruins and in temperate and tropical forests . Natu usually forages for food on the ground. However, on rare occasions, it will hop onto branches to peck at the tree's new shoots. It also picks food from cactus plants, easily avoiding the buds and spines. Due to its prophetic abilities, Natu is a very cautious Pok\u00e9mon that is easily spooked. It has the quirky behavior of staring at something until the thing moves.",

            "description": "Xatu is a green, condor -like Pok\u00e9mon with long, red-and-black tipped white wings that cover most of its front. Underneath its wings are designs that resemble red eyes. Along with its main green coloration, Xatu's design has accents of black, yellow, and red. There is an extra set of yellow stripes on a male Xatu. It has almond eyes, a long, slightly hooked beak, and two long, red feather crests. Xatu's feet have only two toes, one in front and one in back. Xatu's design is similar to a totem pole or a kachina doll .\nXatu tends to stand still all day, constantly observing the sun's movement. One theory explains that Xatu can see into the future with its right eye and the past with its left, and it does not move due to fears of its visions of the future coming true. The Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Xatu the Future has shown that it can communicate by moving its wings in a semaphore fashion. Xatu is believed to live in the forests of South America .",

            "description": "Mareep is an ovine Pok\u00e9mon with fluffy cream-colored wool covering its entire body, as well as a curly tuft of wool in the middle of its head. Its head is blue, and it has black eyes. Its four feet are blue and have two digits on each foot, and it appears to be on tiptoe at all times. Its conical ears and tail have a yellow-and-black striped pattern. Mareep has an orange sphere at the end of its tail, which acts like a small light bulb. This sphere glows brighter the more electricity and heat it has.\nMareep's wool grows continuously and stores electricity, rubbing together and building a static charge. Its volume increases when it builds up with electricity. Touching the wool when it is charged will result in a static shock. During the summer, the fleece is shed, but it grows back in a week. Air is also stored in its fur, which allows it to stay cool during summer and warm during winter. It tends to avoid battles in the wild and has a mild disposition. Mareep is most often found in grassy fields , though it can also be found in farms where its wool is used to make high-quality clothing. Clothing made from Mareep's wool builds up static electricity easily, and as such, a special process has to be used on it. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Mareep is known to roll over in its sleep. [1]",

A white mane of wool covers its head and upper body. This mane forms sideways curls on the top of its head. It has stubby arms and one nail on each foot. Flaaffy's long tail has black stripes and is tipped with a blue orb.\nStoring too much electricity caused Flaaffy to lose the wool over most of its body, but the bare, rubbery skin protects it from the electricity stored in its fleece. The quality of Flaaffy's fleece can change to generate more electricity with less wool. The orb will light up when Flaaffy's mane is fully charged, and it can attack by firing electrified hairs at opponents. Flaaffy typically inhabits grassy meadows and fields , though it can also be found in farms, where its wool is used to create high-quality clothing. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , on rare occasions a sleeping Flaaffy's tail can be seen lighting up after being fully charged. [1]",

Its long neck has several black rings around it near the base. Its stubby arms resemble flippers and each foot has a single white nail. It has a long, black-striped tail with a red orb at the tip. The orb on its tail can shine so bright, that it can be seen from space. People have used the light as a beacon, or to send signals across the ocean. Ampharos is generally found in grasslands , though it can also be found in farms alongside its pre-evolved forms Mareep and Flaaffy . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , the tail light of a sleeping Ampharos can sometimes seen in the distance at night. The reason is due to Ampharos forgetting to turn off its tail light before going to sleep.",

It has two bright red Rafflesia-like flowers on its head and green and yellow leaves around its waist that resemble a skirt, all adding to the appearance of a hula dancer. Bellossom's petals are said to be more beautiful the worse the aroma of the Gloom it evolved from. When it rubs the petals on its head together, it creates a pleasing sound. Bellossom does not possess feet; in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Flower Power , its center-most leaves bent as it was getting ready to spring, suggesting that it uses its leaves as substitutes for feet or legs. However, the Pok\u00e9dex does classify it as a biped.\nBellossom is often seen dancing and chanting. In particular, Bellossom dances when cloudy weather persists, or when the heavy rainfall season ends and it is drawn out by the warm sunlight. Being the result of an evolution via Evolution stone , Bellossom is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in grassy plains , and are more plentiful in the tropics.",

The tail is flexible and configured to stretch, and the ball is full of oil that acts as a buoy to help keep Marill afloat. The ball at the tip of its tail can glow when Marill attacks. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Abandon Ship! , Marill was shown to be able to bounce on its tail. In the TCG , Marill is shown to rapidly spin its tail, seemingly readying for an attack.\nMarill is able to swim in strong water currents without being slowed down by the water's resistance, due to its water-repellent fur. Marill feeds on aquatic plants in addition to fishing for food. When it dives, its tail can be seen bobbing on the water's surface. It will anchor its tail around a tree when fishing at the edge of a fast-moving stream. Marill never gets cold after swimming in cold water, due to its water-repellent fur drying up quickly the moment it leaves the water. It lives on the water's edge .\nPrior to Generation VI , Marill and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Huge Power as an Ability .",

By keeping still and listening closely, it can identify prey even in wild, fast-moving rivers. If Azumarill spots a drowning Pok\u00e9mon, it will make an air bubble that helps them breathe or when Azurill are playing near the rivers.

            "description": "Sudowoodo is a Pok\u00e9mon that has a brown, log-shaped body with yellow spots. It has short legs with toeless feet, and thin forelegs with three green spheres at the ends of its fingers. It has a forked \"branch\" on top of its head, which is shorter on the female than on the male. Despite its appearance, Sudowoodo's composition is closer to a rock than a plant. Originally, it was incorrectly believed to be a Grass-type .\nSudowoodo disguises itself as a tree and stands along paths to avoid being attacked. Sudowoodo's camouflage fails in the winter, as its forelegs remain green, unlike real trees. Sudowoodo is very weak to water and hates it, so whenever it starts to rain, it will break their disguise and flee to the nearest source of shelter. Because it holds its position for so long, its arms have become supple yet strong. It is popular with the elderly, with available magazines and fans devoted to its arm angle and length. Sudowoodo can be found living in forests , sometimes sharing a habitat with Trevenant . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Sudowoodo is known to keep its tree mimicry even when sleeping. However, it will occasionally let of this stance and sleep instead on the ground.\nIn Generation II , Mimic was its signature move , but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .",

It has a long, curled hair on top of its head and pink cheek spots that are smaller on the female than on the male. There is a green swirl on its belly. Its legs are well developed and it has bulbous toes and fingers.\nPolitoed acts as a leader to Poliwag and Poliwhirl , which gather from afar upon hearing its cry. Politoed likes to expand its throat and sing. When three or more assemble, they sing in a chorus with a loud, bellowing voice. The curled hair on Politoed's head is considered proof of its status as a king. The longer and curlier Politoed's hair is, the more Poliwag and Poliwhirl will obey it, and the more it is respected by other Politoed. Politoed is rarely found in the wild, though it is usually seen living by the water's edge .\nAt nightfall, Politoed appears near lakes to make territorial claims through cries that sound like shouting. A male Politoed's cry is said to be louder than a female Politoed's cry. A male Politoed with a deep, menacing voice will become more popular with the opposite gender.",

There is a circular yellow pad on the underside of each foot.\nHoppip's body is very light, and it is easily lifted off the ground by winds and will drift in the air. Hoppip can sense approaching strong winds. In order to avoid being blown away, it clusters and links leaves with other Hoppip or grips the ground firmly with its feet. However, it enjoys gentle breezes. Hoppip tends to be carried by the winds across vast distances, and thus can be found all over the world except in cold regions. It lives in temperate grasslands , fields, mountains, and even urban environments.",

It has large, flat ears on the sides of its head and oval, orange eyes with no pupils. On top of its head is a yellow bloom with a white center. Skiploom spreads its petals to absorb as much sunlight as possible. The bloom on top of its head opens and closes as the temperature fluctuates and its flower blossoms when the temperature rises above 64\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u00a0\u00b0C). Because of this, it is sometimes used as a thermometer. It floats in the air to try to get closer to the sun, but closes its flower and immediately hides under the shade of a tree when it rains. If the weather gets too cold, Skiploom will fly away and migrate to warmer regions so that it can photosynthesize. Some people claim to be able to determine a Skiploom's birth location by the scent coming off of its flower. Skiploom lives in temperate grasslands . As seen in the games , the bloom on its head can turn clockwise.",

Three cotton puffs, almost as large as the body itself, extend off it: one on each arm, and one on top of its head. These puffs produce cotton spores that Jumpluff can use to float in the air, and it can control its flight even in a hurricane. Three to four leaves grow at the base of the top puff.\nJumpluff drifts on seasonal winds and can use its spores to masterfully maneuver itself around the globe. It will spread cotton spores as it floats around to create offspring; inhaling these spores may cause coughs and itchiness. It descends if it encounters cold air currents while it is floating. Though it spends a good amount of time in the air, it is commonly sighted above open temperate grasslands . Once Jumpluff runs out of its cotton spores, its journey \u2014 and its life \u2014 reaches its end.",

Unlike its feet, Aipom's arms are simple, purple stubs.\nAipom uses its powerful tail freely and cleverly for many purposes. The tail is strong enough to anchor Aipom to a branch and suspend the rest of its body in the air, but also delicate enough to pick fruit and manipulate objects. Aipom has been known to wrap its tail around tree branches as it sleeps so it does not fall. Since Aipom uses its tail so much, its actual arms are not as dexterous and become clumsy over time. Aipom lives high in the treetops of tropical, temperate, and even boreal forests , using its tail for balance as it swings from branch to branch. In Alola , Bounsweet is its favorite food.",

Two of the stripes start jaggedly above Sunkern's dark eyes and continue downward. The other stripe is directly below Sunkern's mouth. Since Sunkern's eyelids are brown, the brown streak patterning appears uninterrupted when Sunkern's eyes are closed. Its beady eyes are black with white pupils.\nSunkern is known to be very weak. Aware of its weakness, it only feeds until it evolves. However, it feeds on only the dew from under the leaves of plants. It tries to move as little as possible since it tries to conserve all the nutrients it has stored in its body for evolution. If attacked by predators such as Spearow , it shakes its leaves at the attacker. Sunkern occasionally falls from the sky on early mornings for unknown reasons. A year after a cold summer, the population of Sunkern explodes. Sunkern can be found in temperate, grassy meadows .",

Its head is circular and cream-colored, with yellow petals growing along the rim. The petals become more vivid as the weather becomes warmer. Sunflora's face has two eyes that appear perpetually closed, and a thin line running vertical beside each eye. Sunflora has leaves extending like arms from its round body and two toes on each foot.\nSunflora converts sunlight into nutrition . Because of this, it tends to pursue sunlight and is always looking in the direction of the sun. While the sun is up, it moves around in a hectic manner. When the sun sets, it comes to a complete stop and closes its petals. In addition to sunlight, Sunflora needs plenty of water. Sunflora is rarely seen in the wild, but it can sometimes be found in temperate grassy meadows .",

A bright green mask marking covers most of its face, and it has two spikes on top of its head. Its blue eyes can see all around its body at 360 degrees without even moving its head. This allows Yamma to have a high evasiveness. The end of Yanma's tail has two flat extensions from the sides and two gray spikes in the center.\nYanma is a skillful flier. It can make sudden stops, turn in midair and hover in place by flapping its wings at a high speed. Yamma's eyes ensure the prey will not escape its sight, even when behind. It can also generate shock waves capable of breaking glass or even launching a house skyward by flapping its wings very fast. Yanma is often found in wooded and swampy areas . It hunts insects for food, using its eyesight to spot and its flight abilities to pursue prey. Yanma is also territorial, flitting around to guard its territory.",

It has purple, branching gills on either side of its head; the males have more branches in its gills than the females. Wooper stands on two small, round feet, and it has a large, thick tail. On its belly are dark blue curved markings.\nIt is implied in the Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series episode The Sinnoh Iceberg Race! that Wooper is a dull-witted Pok\u00e9mon oblivious to its surroundings. Wooper lives in cold water most of the time. When sleeping, it partially buries itself in the mud at the bottom. It will occasionally leave the water when the air cools in the evening to search for food along the shore. While walking on land, it coats its body with a slimy, toxic film that keeps its skin from dehydrating and insulates against the cold. The film causes a shooting pain if touched barehanded. It is a timid Pok\u00e9mon and tends to stay close to Quagsire . Arbok is a natural predator of Wooper. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Wooper tends to bury half its body in the mud at the bottom of the water to sleep. When Wooper also does this while sleeping on land. By sleeping in the mud on land, Wooper can keep its skin wet and prevent dehydration.",

It has a wide mouth and tiny, black eyes. A wavy, purple stripe runs down its back. Along its spine is a dark blue fin, which is larger on the male than on the female. Quagsire's hands and feet both have three digits. Its outer layer of skin is slimy and slippery. Quagsire shares many similarities with its Paldean relative, Clodsire .\nQuagsire is carefree and sluggish by nature, although it is protective towards Wooper . An unintelligent Pok\u00e9mon, it tends to bump its head inadvertently while swimming and seems not to care. It hunts for food by leaving its mouth wide open in water and waiting for its unaware prey to blunder in. Because Quagsire does not move, it does not get very hungry and can afford to wait for its food. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Quagsire leaves its mouth open even as it sleeps. It is said seeing a Quagsire asleep with its mouth wide open is a sign it\u2019s possbily waiting for prey, while it dreams. Quagsire lives in clean bodies of freshwater , as well as muddy swamps. During the day, Quagsire avoids sunlight by submerging itself in the water.\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Once in a Blue Moon , wild Quagsire are shown to have an annual celebration at Blue Moon Falls when the moon is full. There they attempt to shoot round objects they have collected to the top of a waterfall with their attacks, to see who can launch their objects the highest, with the apparent target being the moon.",

Its ears are large, and it has purple eyes with white pupils. There are tufts of fur near its eyes, and a small, red gem embedded in its forehead. It also has a thin, forked tail.\nEspeon's velvety fur is so sensitive that it can sense minuscule shifts in the air, allowing it to predict the weather and its enemies' thoughts and movements. When doing so, the tip of its tail quivers. The gem on Espeon's forehead glows when it unleashes psychic energy from the gem and darkens when all of the built-up energy has been exhausted. Espeon builds up its psychic power by bathing in the sunlight. As such, it does not handle battles at night well. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Espeon is known to sleep deeply during the night. Espeon shows extreme loyalty to any Trainer that it considers worthy, even being said to have awakened its psychic powers from its desire to protect its Trainer; some sources, however, theorize that its powers were born from its need to keep itself safe.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon is rare in the wild , instead being more commonly found in urban areas , under the ownership of other Trainers. In Generation II , Morning Sun was its signature move .",

            "description": "Umbreon is a mammalian Pok\u00e9mon which has a sleek, black body with four slender legs and crimson eyes. It has two pairs of pointed teeth (one pair in each jaw) which are visible when its mouth is open. It has long, pointed ears and a bushy tail, each with a yellow band around them. Its forehead and legs have yellow rings on them.\nUmbreon's evolution is the result of Eevee being exposed to the moonlight, which altered its genetic structure. Umbreon's yellow rings glow when it is excited, such as when it leaps to attack; or when exposed to the moon's aura, which fills it with a mysterious energy. Umbreon hunts at night and, as such, has well-developed eyes that can spot a prey even in darkness. Its black fur helps it blend into the night while waiting for the right moment to pounce. When it does, its rings emit a dim yet ominous glow, and it lunges for the prey's throat before eating it. Whenever angered or agitated, Umbreon sprays poisonous sweat secreted from its pores into the offender's eyes to protect itself. Umbreon primarily specializes in defensive prowess. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Umbreon is known to be difficult to find while it sleeps during the night. The main reason is due to Umbreon being a nocturnal Pok\u00e9mon.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon is rare in the wild , instead being more commonly found in urban areas , under the ownership of other Trainers .",

It has a fondness for anything sparkly, and it will go as far as fighting with other Pok\u00e9mon, such as Meowth or Gabite , in order to gain their stashes. However, it is also known to give these sparkly objects to Trainers that it is fond of. Whenever it is chased, it loses the attacker by leading it down dark mountain trails, and sometimes it does this to travelers as a mean-spirited prank. Its thieving and nocturnal nature has led it to become representative of misfortune. It was believed that saying, \"Workrum, Workrum\u2014bad luck, don't come,\" would serve as a protective incantation to drive away bad luck caused by seeing a Murkrow. It is possible to train a Murkrow to repeat words, as seen under Team Rocket 's ownership. Murkrow usually live in flocks (referred to as \"murders\") amongst forests and swamps . Murkrow may also act as a servant of Honchkrow ; with groups of at least 100 flying in at Honchkrow's call. There is a saying for Murkrow that goes, \"Get home before the Murkrow fly.\"",

            "description": "Slowking is a bipedal Pok\u00e9mon with a Shellder latched onto its head. It is primarily pink, with a pale yellow muzzle and scaled belly. Its feet and hands each have a single clawed digit, while the hands also have a clawless thumb. Around its neck is a spiny ruff with alternating red and white stripes. The Shellder on its head has a spiral shape with two horns near the base. A red gem resides in the center of the Shellder. The Shellder's eyes are visible on the back of the Shellder.\nShellder's bite releases venom into Slowpoke's brain, causing a chemical chain-reaction that unlocks a superior intelligence and extraordinary power. More venom is injected into Slowking every time it yawns. The more venom the Shellder releases, the more intelligent Slowking will become. However, if the Shellder on its head comes off, it will forget everything it has learned and would revert itself back to Slowpoke. As seen in Slowking's Crowning! , Slowking's Shellder crown can take control of human who wears the crown. Slowking's intelligence can match that of a human and it constantly attempts to learn more. Its inspiration and intuition are also highly developed, and Slowking is able to stay calm in any situation and plan situations with effective results; this allows Slowking to solve anything. In the games, Slowking's speech is said to be unintelligible; however, in The Power of One , it can understand and speak the human language .\nAccording to The Complete Pok\u00e9mon Pocket Guide , it has such an easygoing personality that it is never stressed. Slowking is rarely found in the wild, though it can be found by the water's edge . It has been seen eating seaweed and drinking coconut milk. In Alola , it is known as \"the sage of the sea\", and it occasionally matches wits with Oranguru by the beach. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Slowking is known to be dreaming world-changing ideas while it sleeps. However, it forgets all of them the moment Slowking wakes up.\nSlowking is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Chilly Reception .",

While it has no visible arms or legs, its lower half has several small appendages and resembles a ruffled dress. It has five round red gems halfway around its neck, which are used to absorb fear and use it as nourishment. When defeated in the side series games, its body disappears, leaving only the gems around its neck behind. This implies that Misdreavus retreats into the gems when it has been severely weakened. It has long, flowing lilac-tipped \"hair\". Misdreavus's large, red eyes have yellow sclerae.\nMisdreavus lives in caves . As a nocturnal Pok\u00e9mon, it spends its days sleeping in darkness and its nights startling people with mischievous tricks. Since it loves watching frightened people, it is known to yank and bite at people's hair or sneak up on them and cry and shriek in a way a child would. In the animated series , Misdreavus is shown to be able to use its \"hair\" to grasp objects and other Pok\u00e9mon, as if it were hands. Flutter Mane shares a resemblance to Misdreavus. It was theorized to be a giant Misdreavus reborn as a pterosaur ghost.\nPrior to Generation IV , Pain Split was its signature move . In Generation II , Psywave was also its signature move. Other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit both moves via breeding .",

It is entirely black, except for its white sclerae. All 26 alphabetic forms of Unown have fully open eyes, while the two punctuation forms have half-closed eyes. Though each of its forms has a counterpart in the Latin alphabet, Unown is said to resemble ancient writing and hieroglyphs called Unown symbols . It is a mystery whether Unown predates or postdates written language, and therefore which one is based on the other. Unown can move its appendages independently like tentacles or fingers.\nIn the Japanese version of Pok\u00e9mon Crystal , a researcher implies that the Unown began appearing at the Ruins of Alph after the Pok\u00e9mon Communication Center was built in Goldenrod City , implying the Unown have some connection to radio waves or telecommunications. This text was translated and left unused in the English release. [1]\nThe Pok\u00e9dex and Professor Oak 's research disagree on whether Unown communicates using electromagnetic waves or telepathy. Either way, it can be detected by the Pok\u00e9gear radio, which interprets it as the melody of the Azure Flute . Unown has an unknown connection to Arceus . It is said that an \"odd power\" emerges when more than one Unown come together. Certain Unown loose in the Hisui region were capable of repelling Pok\u00e9 Balls that contained Pok\u00e9mon, preventing them from being battled . Professor Laventon 's research observed that Unown resemble human writing from other lands, though no one took him seriously. In the Pok\u00e9mon movie Spell of the Unown: Entei , Unown is shown to be capable of reading the thoughts of other life forms. Great numbers of Unown are capable of distorting reality to suit the dreams and wishes of whoever is in control of the Unown. However, they can only do this when more Unown are present, so it could be a shared effort rather than an ability unique to each Unown.\nUnown is an extremely rare Pok\u00e9mon that lives in its own dimension and rarely ventures outside. When it moves to the Pok\u00e9mon world , Unown tends to stick to walls like engravings of ancient texts, or orbit other Unown, usually in ruins .\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Crystal, the Unown are said to share a cooperative bond with Suicune . [2]\nIn Generation VIII , Unown is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Hidden Power .",

There are two eyespots on its black tail. Its eyespots are revealed to be capable of blinking and looking around using its tail in the Pok\u00e9mon Stadium series . Wobbuffet is very protective of its tail, to the point where it will suddenly turn uncharacteristically aggressive if the tail is attacked.\nWobbuffet is usually a docile Pok\u00e9mon that will never attack first. However, when it is attacked, it will inflate its body and initiate a counter-strike. When two or more of this Pok\u00e9mon meet, they will attempt to outlast each other in a battle of endurance. However, since neither is able to attack, they may compete to see which can last without food. Because of its overprotective nature regarding its tail and hatred of light, Wobbuffet lives in dark caves . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Wobbuffet is known to keep its tail hidden even while it sleeps. However, it will drop its guard when deeply asleep, exposing its tail completely.\nPrior to Generation V , Wobbuffet and its pre-evolved form, Wynaut , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Shadow Tag as an Ability .",

It has two ossicones with bulbous tips on top of its head. Its front half is yellow with brown spots, while its back half is brown with yellow spots. The brown section on female Girafarig is smaller than that of the male. There are many triangular, pink spikes along its back. Girafarig lives in savannas and grasslands , where it feeds on the plant life.\nGirafarig's tail possesses a head of its own. The tail's head has yellow eyes, a mouth full of sharp teeth, and a small brain. However, this head is incapable of independent thinking and relies on outside stimuli such as smell to guide its actions. If the tail smells something alluring, it will bite. The tail often mimics the head during feeding and is able to warn the Pok\u00e9mon of danger if it is sleeping. The tail head can also unleash psychic powers.\nGirafarig and its evolved form, Farigiraf , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Twin Beam .",

The glue is made of fluid that Pineco spits out, which hardens when it is exposed to air. Pineco's shell becomes bigger and thicker as more tree bark is accumulated; older Pineco are very large in size.\nUnbothered by the added weight of its shell, Pineco patiently hangs from a tree branch in tropical and temperate forests , waiting to prey on flying insects. In Alola , its favorite prey is Cutiefly . Typically immobile, it will drop to the ground and explode if someone shakes its tree while it is eating.",

Between the spikes, the inner shell opens along a straight line to reveal Forretress's eyes, which are round with large pupils. Whatever else lies inside its shell is unknown.\nForretress can defend itself from enemies by shooting out pieces of its outer shell, as a conditioned reflex rather than a conscious effort. It opens its shell to capture prey, but this happens so quickly that its interior body cannot be seen. It lives in tropical and temperate forests , attaching itself immovably to tree trunks.

Its head is round with a wide mouth extending under its jowls and curving up toward the middle of its face. Its chin is blue with two rounded prongs. Its eyes\u2014round and rimmed with blue\u2014are kept closed, revealing its cream-colored eyelids. On Dunsparce's upper back are two tiny white wings. Its body ends in a drill-like tail.\nDunsparce can float slightly with its wings, which some scientists believe were used to fly in the sky during ancient times. However, it avoids detection and flees when spotted by burrowing into the ground with its tail. It lives immobile in caves and beneath the earth, where it makes maze-like nests. They get along with Diglett and share tunnels with each other. Dunsparce can navigate through its nests without getting lost by the smell of the dirt.\nDunsparce and its evolved form, Dudunsparce , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Hyper Drill .",

It has long, triangular ears and triangular eyes with small pupils. Two large pointed teeth protrude from its upper jaw, and a pink tongue is often seen lolling from its mouth. Its arms are segmented at the wrists and end in large pincers. Spread between its arms are two blue wing membranes, each tipped with a purple claw. Its legs are thin and likewise segmented at the ankles, with its round feet having one claw each. Gligar has a long tail split into spherical sections, ending in a large, round stinger. The female Gligar will have a smaller stinger than the male.\nAs shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Riding the Winds of Change! , Gligar feed on Berries and can emit sound waves to detect obstacles and fly around them. It glides smoothly and silently through the air with its limbs extended, and startles its prey and enemies by flying straight toward them. It attacks by clamping onto its enemy's face with its clawed hind legs and pincers, then jabbing it with its poisonous stinger. Gligar itself is resistant to opponents' venom . Gligar lives in mountainous regions , making its nest along cliff sides. When it is done gliding, it hops along the ground back to its nest. In Hisui , it is revealed that Gligar can survive even freezing temperatures.",

Three of those sections have long rock spikes coming out of them on either side. It has a massive head mainly made up of its large, wide jaw with sets of large square teeth inside. Along its bottom jaw are ridges: there are two pairs of ridges on a male Steelix, while there is only one pair on a female. Several small, square lumps cover the underside of its lower jaw. Its eye sockets are slightly deep-set, and the eyes themselves are red. Its head has two long ridges going from the eyes up to the top of its head. The tip of its tail is conical with a blunt tip.\nSteelix burrows up to six-tenths of a mile underground, even further than its pre-evolved form Onix , and it can be found in mountains or caves . Steelix can dig even towards the world 's core. It easily chews through boulders with its powerful jaws, and its eyes are capable of seeing in the dark. Exposure to underground heat and pressures alongside its iron-rich soil diet has made its body harder than diamonds. Steelix's evolution is said to have been the result of an Onix's composition becoming more diamond-like after living for about 100 years. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Steelix is known to sleep in a upright postion. As noted by researchers, it can maintain this superb balance without even toppling over.\nA special Steelix is worshiped in Lental for being one of the seven guardian Illumina Pok\u00e9mon . It resides in the Durice Island Illumina Spot .",

            "description": "Granbull is a purple, bipedal, bulldog -like Pok\u00e9mon . It has a prominent lower jaw with two long, fang-like growths. Its upper jaw has two small fangs. The jaws are so heavy that the Pok\u00e9mon has trouble keeping its head up. On the sides of its head are flat, curved ears, and its small nose is black. There is a black collar around its neck with two small white markings on it. Around its wrists are two black band markings, and it has a short tail.\nA Granbull's main weapons are its well-developed lower jaw and heavy fangs. The bite from its jaws is said to be very powerful. However, due to how heavy its jaws are, Granbull keeps its head tilted down constantly for balance. Despite its fierce appearance, it is actually very timid and sensitive, even more so than Snubbull . Granbull rarely bites as it prefers not to get involved in disputes. Unless Granbull is startled, it will not bite indiscriminately. If attacked, it will flail about to fend off its attacker. Granbull is popular with young people due to how it acts and looks. It is considered too incompetent to be a guard dog due to its nature. Granbull wanders around urban areas .",

The upper half of its body is dark teal and the lower half is light greenish-yellow. Its tail is tall and thin with a dark teal outline, light greenish-yellow inside, and two dark teal dots in the center that resemble the Japanese character \u30cf Ha . Its eyes are even with its body and are always seen slanted angrily. Below its eyes are its puffy pink lips. All around its body are sharp, conical spikes, which evolved from scales over time.\nIn order to attack, Qwilfish drinks over 2.6 gallons (10 litres) of water to inflate its body. It then uses the water pressure to shoot poisonous quills at its foe, which can cause fainting. Qwilfish is briefly left defenseless shortly after firing its quills; this is believed by some expert fishers to be the opportune moment to catch this Pok\u00e9mon. Due to its round body, Qwilfish is not a great swimmer, and when filled with water it is even harder for it to swim. When Qwilfish faces a larger opponent, it will inflate its body to match its size as close as it can. If it is startled while inflated, it will spit out all its water, propelling itself away.",

Its rounded head has three blunt horns extending above its forehead and eyes with dark yellow irises. Scizor's thin, black neck connects to a black, teardrop-shaped patch on its thorax. Scizor has broad shoulders and thin, segmented arms ending in large, round pincers, which comprise a third of Scizor's body weight. Scizor has a large, rounded abdomen with three black, chevron-shaped stripes extending from its waist down its front; female Scizor has larger abdomens than male Scizor. Scizor's legs are defined by large hip joints, thin thighs, and wide calves, and its feet end in a clawed toe on each side. Its arms appear similar to pincers of animals from crustecean group like crabs and the presence of markings resembling eyes gives the illusion of additional heads.\nScizor's body and muscles are made of metal that is as hard as steel, with pincers strong enough to crush any hard object. They can be opened and closed like jaws and are patterned with black eyespots with yellow \"pupils\". It will raise its pincers and wave them around to scare off predators or foes, giving it the appearance of having three heads. When it identifies an enemy, Scizor will use its pincers to beat up the opponent to the point there is nothing but scrap left afterwards. Scizor is normally incapable of flight, instead it quickly flaps its wings to regulate its body temperature to prevent itself from becoming too hot and melting, although it still can hover and glide for short distances, as shown in the games and animated series . It has tremendous power despite its slim body. Scizor is rarely found in the wild, though it can be found in grasslands .",

            "description": "Heracross is a bipedal, coleopteran insectoid Pok\u00e9mon covered in a blue exoskeleton. There is a long, pronged horn on its forehead. The horn ends in a cross on males and a heart-shape on females. On either side of the horn is a short antenna with a spherical tip. Heracross has oval, yellow eyes. Its forearms have a pair of spikes near the wrists, while its thighs have a single spike each. It has two claws on its hands, and a single long claw on each foot. There is a single pair of wings covered by elytra , which can be seen during its release from a Pok\u00e9 Ball in the 3D games. Heracross's claws allow it to dig into the ground for sturdy footing and also allow it to climb trees. Using its horn, it throws opponents or competitors for food. It can lift and throw objects 100 times its own weight. It uses its two antennae to search for food by scent. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Heracross is known to occasionaly sleep while licking the sap it finds. The reason is due to Heracross becoming exhausted from a potentinally hard search for sweet sap. It lives in boreal, temperate, and tropical forests , where it feeds on tree sap. In Generation II , Megahorn was its signature move .\nAs seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode A Sappy Ending , Heracross has been known to compete with Pok\u00e9mon such as Pinsir for food. The same episode also shows Heracross allowing Butterfree to feed on tree sap after Heracross has finished its meal. In addition, it is shown to suck sap from Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon such as Bulbasaur . In Alola , Heracross get along better with Pinsir, as they both have rivalries with Vikavolt .",

            "description": "Sneasel is a bipedal mustelid Pok\u00e9mon that resembles both a cat and a weasel. It is primarily bluish-black with three bright red feathers for its tail and a single one on its left ear. The ear feather is shorter on the female than on the male. The other ear is short and pointed, and it has narrow red eyes. On its forehead and chest are oval, yellow gem-like protrusions. It has red eyes with black eyelash-like markings on the edges. It has long limbs with two large, white retractable claws on its hands and feet. It is perfectly capable of using its claws to do substantial damage. Its claws are also used for climbing trees in boreal or sub-alpine forests where it lives. It can also bring out its claws to startle foes that attacked it.\nSneasel is a smart, sneaky, and notoriously vicious Pok\u00e9mon, and blends well into the night in order to ambush their prey. Sneasel feeds on Eggs , such as those of Pidgey , that it steals from unattended nests. It uses its claws to poke a hole in the Egg before slurping the contents out. It has been known to form pairs to hunt: one Sneasel will lure the parents away from their nest, while the other steals their Eggs. Although the Sneasel pair works together, they will also fight over their hunt among themselves. As a result of its Egg-based diet, Sneasel are despised by Breeders to the point where they try to drive away or eradicate the former. Sneasel also preys on Alolan Sandshrew , but the Sandshrew's skin is so hard that it can cause Sneasel's claws to snap off.\nPrior to Generation IV , Beat Up was its signature move , but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .",

When it feels nervous, it will lick its paws to calm itself down. The marking on its face can glow when it finds honey. While Teddiursa is able to make its own honey by blending pollen collected by Beedrill with fruits, it is also known to steal honey from Combee nests, which it finds by stealthily following the Combee. Teddiursa lives in mountainous forests , where it will hide food throughout its territory before food becomes scarce in winter.",

It has narrow eyes, a triangular, black nose, and a wide mouth with small, visible fangs in the upper jaw. The fur on Ursaring's shoulders is longer and more structured, with rectangular extensions. A female Ursaring has longer fur on its shoulders than a male. There is a large, yellow, ring-shaped mark shaped like a new moon on its chest. Ursaring's forelimbs are long, ending in five claws each, while its hind legs are short and thick, ending in three claws each. Its tail is large and spherical in shape.\nUrsaring lives in mountainous forests , sleeping in treetops and gathering food throughout the day. While it is skilled at climbing trees, it gathers food by snapping them and collecting whatever Berries or fruits fall down. It will mark trees bearing delicious fruit in its territory with its claws. Ursaring is also known to regularly eat honey, which is its favorite food. Ursaring's sense of smell can distinguish any aroma, and as such, it can find food buried deep underground or in streams. It will also search for food during the winter season. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Going for a Spinda , Ursaring is highly protective of its cubs, and in the original series episode Forest Grumps , it's shown to become more aggressive during mating season. It also becomes more ferocious when it is hungry. Ursaring are known to get into fights with Primeape when they encounter each other while searching for berries. When exposed to peat found in Hisui during a full moon, Ursaring can evolve into Ursaluna .",

Its lower body is irregular in shape, and occasionally emits bubbles.\nSlugma's circulatory system is composed entirely of magma, which delivers vital nutrients and oxygen to its organs. To prevent its body from cooling and hardening, Slugma neither sleeps nor ever stops moving. If its body does begin to cool, it will become brittle and may break apart. Slugma constantly seeks warm places and gathers with other members of its species in mountains and volcanoes. Slugma takes magma baths to heal itself. It is believed that when volcanoes were more active in ancient times, Slugma were seen more often.",

Its oval eyes are large and yellow with small pupils and extend upward from its head. It has a bulbous snout and a wide mouth, with two drops of magma dangling from each side of its upper jaw. Magcargo's back is protected by a gray, spherical shell composed of hardened, but brittle magma, forming irregular lumps and plates. Marcargo can store fire energy in its shell. A streak of fire leaks from the side of its shell. Magcargo's lower body is amorphous and covered in bubbles of magma.\nMagcargo's internal body temperature can reach over 18,000\u00a0\u00b0F (10,000\u00a0\u00b0C), causing it to evaporate water on contact. Flames circulate throughout its body, occasionally spouting through cracks in its shell. While its shell is brittle enough to be shattered with a slight touch, Magcargo can reform its body by dipping itself in magma. It can be found in mountainous regions and has been living in volcano craters for tens of thousands of years. According to one folklore, when the wild Marcargo population suddenly increases, it's a sign that a volcano eruption is coming.",

Swinub's eyes appear as if they are perpetually closed.\nThe only time that Swinub's eyes have been seen open was in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , during the battle between Pryce and Erika in Bringing up Bellossom , when Pryce ordered his Swinub to dodge Erika's Skiploom 's attack.\nSwinub uses its pink, pig-like nose to dig through mud and snow, looking for anything edible. In Hisui , ancient people relied on Swinub a lot because of this skill. Occasionally, it will come across hot springs while scouring the ground. Its favorite food is a type of mushroom that grows beneath dead grass, though it also eats Berries. When a Swinub finds an attractive smell, it will run desperately to find out the source of the aroma. It inhabits cold places, such as icy caves , mountainous regions, and frozen tundra.",

These tusks thicken when it snows, and they are smaller on a female Piloswine than on a male. It has floppy ears that are sensitive to sound. Piloswine has two beady eyes in its head; however, these are usually covered up by tufts of fur. As it is usually unable to see, it checks surroundings with its sensitive pig-like nose instead. As a result, Piloswine is constantly charging at foes when it moves. The hairs on its back stands up straight as a warning sign for this.\nPiloswine's thick fur allows it to survive in harshly cold environments that it inhabits, such as icy caves , mountainous regions and frozen tundra. Its fur is so long that it usually covers its small, hooved legs. Despite the small size of its legs, its hooves ensure even footing on icy ground. Piloswine often digs for food buried beneath snow and ice using its tusks.",

There is a smaller, blunt horn on its forehead, and it has black, oval eyes. It has a light-blue underside, which speckles towards the sides. Its four legs and two arms are blunt and stubby.\nSmaller Pok\u00e9mon like Horsea and Luvdisc are sometimes sheltered by Corsola's branches, and even offer it protection from foes. Corsola's horn is a prized material, commonly used for jewelry and carving, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode A Corsola Caper! . Some people keep Corsola branches as charms to promote safe childbirth. Corsola's branches glitter very beautifully in seven colors when they catch sunlight. If any branch breaks off, this Pok\u00e9mon grows it back in just one night.\nFound in the warm shallow waters of southern seas, Corsola requires clean water to live. If its habitat is dirty, the growths on its back become discolored and degenerate. However, when it is healthy, its growths regularly shed and grow back; it is able to regrow them over the course of a single night. It forms large social groups. Occasionally, these groups get so large that people may live atop them, as is the case in Pacifidlog Town .\nIn the Alola region , Mareanie and Toxapex are natural predators of Corsola, preying on its branches. If pursued by them, Corsola will sometimes snap its own branches off as a diversion. Conversely, Mareanie and Toxapex do not prey on Corsola in the Galar region, having not developed a taste for its branches.",

There are two dark stripes on its back that resembles the barrel of a revolver. It has a single pelvic fin positioned like a revolver's trigger, two small pectoral fins, and a dorsal fin near its mouth resembling a gun's front sight. In addition, it has two caudal fins, the bottom of which resembling the butt of a gun and the top resembling the hammer. All of its fins except for the dorsal fin are white. For a long period of time, due to their vast anatomical differences, no one believed that Remoraid evolved into Octillery .\nRemoraid is well known for its ability to shoot jets of water out of its mouth with incredible accuracy and distance. It uses its abdominal muscles to do so, often to shoot down prey, such as Burmy , out of the air. The water attack can reach its prey from over 300 feet (100 meters) away, even when the prey is moving or flying. Because of this, Remoraid is referred to as the \"sniper of the seas.\" When threatened, it can also shoot water to propel itself backward.\nRemoraid tends to travel by attaching to Mantine 's fins or in large groups of its own kind. It attaches itself by using its dorsal fin, which acts like a suction pad. When attached to a Mantine, it feeds on whatever the Mantine leaves behind, but will fight alongside it as well. A school of Remoraid is often seen working together and traveling with a Mantyke , helping it achieve its evolution into Mantine. Remoraid is a sea-dwelling Pok\u00e9mon, travelling downstream from rivers especially when evolution draws near.",

There are yellow bumps on its rock-hard head and yellow suction cups on each of its eight tentacles. These suction cups and yellow bumps are smaller on a female Octillery. It uses its tentacles for manipulating objects and the suction cups give it strong gripping power. Because of this, it is very hard for it to be blown away.\nOctillery is a relaxed Pok\u00e9mon who loves fuss from its Trainer. Even though it is more docile when domesticated, it can be very stubborn at times in the wild. It instinctively sneaks into rocky holes or pots, and if it gets sleepy, it steals the nest of a fellow Octillery. When threatened, it will spurt ink from its mouth to cover itself before escaping, allowing it to protect itself and its young from danger. Octillery's ink obscures vision and contains substances that dull predators' sense of smell. Octillery also uses this ink on its prey, before its suction cups hold the prey tightly. Its ink can also be used as a cooking ingredient. Besides ink, Octillery sometimes uses its rock-hard head on its foes. Prior to Generation VIII , Octazooka was its signature move , but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .\nOctillery is normally found in oceans and caves. For a long time, people refused to believe Octillery was an evolution of Remoraid , because of the extreme physical differences between the two. It is thought to be a distant relative to Omastar . In New Pok\u00e9mon Snap , an Octillery can be seen about to be preyed on by a Seviper .",

Black markings surround its circular eyes, and it has a light yellow beak and feet. There is a single white spot on its stomach. Its feet have two digits each.\nDelibird is omnivorous. It carries food bundled up in its tail. It normally gives stored food to its chicks, but has been known to share its food with humans stranded on icy mountains. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Delibird is known to sleep while occasionally reaching inside its tail to pull something out. Prior to Generation IX , Delibird was the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Present by leveling up. Present allows it to carry special items in its tail that may cause damage or heal its opponent. In a flock, the Delibird with the largest tail is its leader. Delibird tends to live in mountainous regions , making its nests over sharp cliffs; notably around Mt. Everest. Iron Bundle shares a resemblance to Delibird and is believed to be a Delibird-based machine built by an ancient civilization.",

Its head has two long protrusions resembling horns or antennae, and two more black ring-shaped marks on the back. Two pairs of gills are visible on its pinkish gray underside, as well as a pair of beady eyes and a small mouth. Its body has a coarse texture.\nMantine thrives in open seas where it swims freely, often in schools where they race one another. It can breach out of the water and fly 300 feet (100 meters) into the air if it builds up enough speed. In the past , it was often misidentified as a bird Pok\u00e9mon by observers who saw this behavior. Mantine is sometimes seen with a Remoraid attached to the underside of one of its fins, scavenging for its leftovers and fighting together with it when attacked. Mantine has a docile nature, and does not mind the Remoraid clinging onto its fin.\nIn Alola , many surfers ride waves and travel between islands on the backs of Mantine . This has made it an icon in the region, being featured on souvenir postcards and posters.",

It has yellow eyes, a pointed beak with several pointed teeth, and a triangular crest on its head. There are red feathers under the sheaths that cover its sharp wings, and each feather can be moved independently. Its wings are actually hollow, allowing it to travel up to 185\u00a0mph (300\u00a0km/h). Its feet have three toes on them, two in front and one in back, and its tail has hooked ends.\nIts steel wings become tattered and bashed in from repeated battles, but once a year the battered wings grow back completely. This process restores the cutting edges of its feathers, which are sharp enough to be used as blades and sharper than any man-made sword. Its skin and feathers are solid due to being raised in very harsh conditions . Its nests are usually found in thorn bushes, where continual scratching of a young individual's skin will eventually harden it into an iron-like state. However, water can cause Skarmory's hard body to rust easily, so it stays in its nest on rainy days. In ancient regions where these Pok\u00e9mon are common, warriors would use the sharp feathers that fell off Skarmory as swords. It is a popular Pok\u00e9mon that is used for heraldic designs, and in Galar , it has violent territorial clashes with Corviknight . In Blueberry Academy , Skarmory is used for the school's Flying Taxi service.\nIn Generation V , Steel Wing was its signature move , but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .",

Houndour appears to have a simplistic, stylized skull on its forehead with the eye orbits creating eyebrow patterning above its actual eyes. It also has circular, red paw pads on each of its three-toed paws.\nHoundour is an intelligent Pok\u00e9mon that forms packs to hunt for prey and shows unparalleled teamwork. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Hour of the Houndour , it will not abandon a pack member who is sick. It communicates using various barks and howls. Barks are used to determine the location of a pack member during a hunt, which only they can understand, while howls are used as a declaration of ownership over territory. They are known to be loyal and obedient to their Trainers . Houndour can typically be found around rough terrain . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Houndour is known to howl while it sleeps. It is believed that Houndour is dreaming of hunting alongside the rest of its pack.",

            "description": "Houndoom is a quadrupedal, canine Pok\u00e9mon with black fur, a long orange snout, and an orange underbelly. It has small red eyes and a black nose. Around its neck is a white band with a small skull-shaped pendant on its throat. There are two white bands on each of its ankles, as well as three rib-like ridges on its back. Houndoom has a long, skinny tail with a triangular tip and three clawed toes on each paw. Atop its head is a pair of long, curved gray horns. These horns are smaller on the female than the male. Unlike its pre-evolution, it does not have discernable ears.\nHoundoom live in packs. The one with its horns raked sharply towards the back serves a leadership role. Leadership is determined by fights within the pack. It is believed that Houndoom dreams about this leadership role while it sleeps. Its gut is full of toxins, which are used to create unique fire mixed with poison. This gives Houndoom's fire a foul odor and the burns it inflicts will never heal. After finishing off its prey, Houndoom divides it evenly among its pack. Houndoom appears near rough terrain areas . Its howling induces shivering in other Pok\u00e9mon, and often sends them scurrying back to their nests. In the past, people thought Houndoom's howl came from the grim reaper. Houndoom usually breathes fire when it is angry. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Houndoom is known to rarely breathe out flames while it sleeps. [1]",

It is covered in blue scales except for its yellow, compact belly scales. There are thin spines with a single branch atop its head and thin, white fins under its cheeks. Its thin snout is powerful, allowing squirts of water jets with devastating power to be fired. Two-pronged fins extend slightly past its cheeks. On its back is a white fin supported by thin, blue spines similar to the ones on its head.\nThe yawn of a sleeping Kingdra is powerful enough to create undercurrents capable of destroying small ships. Should it decide to emerge from the depths of the ocean, Kingdra's strength can create large whirlpools and waterspouts on the surface. Because of its immense power, Kingdra often hibernates deep in uninhabited areas of the sea to build up its energy, usually at the bottom of the seas. When a storm arrives, Kingdra is said to awaken and wander about in search of prey. Kingdra's awakening can cause tornadoes. It is known to have fierce battles with Dragonite whenever they meet. Kingdra's gleaming scales are gifted to royals.",

When this Pok\u00e9mon curls up, the band resembles a car tire. This tough hide prevents regular attacks from inflicting even a scratch. A pair of white tusks, which are smaller on the female, extend from the corners of its mouth. It has thin, elongated ears held out almost perpendicular to its body. Its four short legs are each encircled with a broken, black band and have three toes.\nDonphan has the ability to curl up into a ball and violently roll around like a wheel. These rolling tackles are strong enough to knock down a house. While normally calm, Donphan can become enraged and start a rampage. Once it starts its rampage, it will be almost unstoppable. Donphan will chase after anyone who angers it. The Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Date Expectations showed that this ability is further used as a form of courtship. The male Donphan have rolling competitions to demonstrate their toughness to the females. A Donphan's tough hide is so strong, not even a car can scratch it. Despite this, the armor is extremely vulnerable to rain.\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Roll On, Pok\u00e9mon! , it is shown that Donphan has a keen sense of smell, capable of sniffing out a gem known as amberite (Agate in the Japanese version). Donphan travels in herds with a ranking system. The larger its tusks, the higher its rank in the herd. It lives in rough , mountainous terrain.\nBoth Great Tusk and Iron Treads share a resemblance to Donphan. Great Tusk is theorized to be Donphan's ancient ancestor from the dinosaur era, while Iron Treads is believed to be a descendant of Donphan or a scientific weapon sent to the Pok\u00e9mon world by aliens.",

Its legs are simple ovoid growths along its sides, and its tail widens towards the middle. Its bill, legs, tail, and underside are blue.\nPorygon2's evolution from Porygon was the result of it being upgraded from the most cutting-edge technology available. It was upgraded to work in space for planetary devolvement reasons, although its inability to fly limits this ability. It is artificially intelligent and capable of learning new behaviors on its own, including information it does not need to know. It can also speak a strange language only other Porygon2 can understand. As a result, it will sometimes perform motions or abilities that are not in its programming. It is generally found in computers or in labs and other buildings working with people. It can survive in a space vacuum, though cannot move very well in zero gravity. In ancient Hisui , people were confused about Porygon2 and its evolutionary relatives due to them arriving through space-time distortions and being the product of far more advanced technology than what was available at the time.\nPorygon2 and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Conversion and Conversion 2 . Additionally, prior to Generation V and in Generation IX , Porygon2 and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Download as an Ability .",

Its tail is large, short, and round, and each of its legs ends in a black hoof. It has a large, brown nose and a pair of pale cream-colored antlers, each with a black orb in the center. The shape of the antlers and the black orbs causes them to resemble eyes. Stantler can distort reality and create illusions with its antlers by subtly changing the flow of air around them. Staring into them creates an odd sensation, as if one is being sucked through them, and one may become so dizzy that it is impossible to stand. The orbs on the antlers have a pleasant scent, which can induce a bewildering effect on people. The orbs can also be ground into a powder that aids in sleeping.\nStantler's strange antlers were very valuable as works of art, and as such, the species was nearly hunted to extinction. Stantler live in herds in temperate, mountainous forests ; these herds are sometimes led by a Wyrdeer . As shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Little Big Horn , a baby Stantler that is separated from its herd and frightened will instinctively produce an illusion of a big, stampeding herd to scare away perceived threats. In the past, Stantler lived in tougher environments with more enemies, which strengthened its psychic powers and allowed it to evolve into Wyrdeer.\nStantler and its evolved form, Wyrdeer, are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Psyshield Bash .",

This paintbrush oozes with paint, and the color of the paint may vary for each Smeargle, as well as change in hue corresponding to its emotions. Smeargle has a footprint on its back that is typically the same color as the paint on the tip of its tail, though Smeargle can have separate back and tail colors in Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2 . The mark is placed on Smeargle's back as a sign of adulthood. Smeargle also has a round structure on its head with a point that resembles a beret . It has floppy, brown ears and a brown collar on its neck. The rings encircling Smeargle's eyes are also brown, as are Smeargle's eyelids. Its arms have two brown bands, and its legs have only one. Each of its limbs has three digits.\nSmeargle's in-game appearances in Pok\u00e9mon Gold, Silver , and Crystal as well as Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum and Pok\u00e9mon XD: Gale of Darkness all depict it with red paint on its back and tail while its Shiny coloration is depicted with green; the inverse is true in the Generation III core series games and in every game from Generation IV onwards. Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2 and the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Art of Pok\u00e9mon both depict Smeargle that have blue back and tail colors, with the animated series episode also depicting Smeargle that have yellow back and tail colors. Its Shiny coloration in Stadium 2 can also be seen with teal, orange, or indigo paint on its back and tail.\nSmeargle uses its paint to mark its territory. There are over 5,000 known different marks that Smeargle uses. Each Smeargle's tail is predetermined by the mysterious fluid secreted at the tip of the tail. There are Smeargle fanatics who will pay big money to own one. It can also use its signature move , Sketch , to copy moves from other Pok\u00e9mon. Smeargle is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Sketch. Smeargle is often found in urban areas filled with graffiti.",

There are white bands resembling bandages on its torso and wrists. It has thin limbs, and its hands have three fingers each. Tyrogue is a male-only species with no female counterpart.\nTyrogue is famous for its eagerness to compete and boundless energy, to such an extent that it will challenge anyone, even larger foes. This is the famous intense desire that Tyrogue is known for. Determined to make itself stronger, Tyrogue will not quit no matter how many times it loses. While it is small, Tyrogue should not be ignored as it can slug a target without warning. As a result, it is always nursing its injuries from fighting opponents larger than itself. As Tyrogue becomes stressed if it is not able to train every day, its Trainer must maintain a regular training schedule. It is usually found in urban areas. The training Tyrogue does influences its possible evolution into either Hitmonlee , Hitmonchan , or Hitmontop .",

            "description": "Hitmontop is a vaguely humanoid Pok\u00e9mon capable of spinning on its head. Its main body is spherical and mostly blue with a brown triangular patch on its chest. Hitmontop has short legs with white bands near the hands and feet. The feet are large, blue, and have a circular brown pad on the underside. It has a skinny brown retractable tail that ends with a blue sphere with a spike on it. Its head is round and brown with flat, curved extensions on either side and a single spike on top. The spike horn is made from the same substance that creates both its fur and claws. The horn is continuously growing through Hitmontop's lifetime. It has beady, black eyes, and spherical hands with no digits. Hitmontop is a male-only species with no female counterpart.\nHitmontop is very adept at fighting with dance-like kicks. This technique has an amazing combination of both offense and defense at the same time. Hitmontop moves more quickly by spinning on the spike on its head than it does by walking normally. Capable of spinning at high speeds, it may bore into the ground similar to a drill. While spinning, Hitmontop delivers smooth, graceful kicks. The centrifugal force of Hitmontop's spins boosts the destructive power of its attacks by a factor of 10. Anyone enchanted by its kicks will often get drilled hard by Hitmontop's kicks. Hitmontop often competes with Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan . As an urban species , it is often found in towns and cities.\nPrior to Generation VII and in Generation IX , Hitmontop is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Triple Kick . Additionally, prior to Generation VII, Hitmontop and its evolutionary relative, Hitmonlee, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Rolling Kick .",

There are several tufts of hair sticking up on top of its head. Its skin is light purple with a cream-colored chest, arms, and feet. It has large, blue-green eyes and a pair of large, pink lips. These lips are sensitive enough that Smoochum uses them to identify and examine objects that it sees for the first time, and are kept moist by its daily application of tree sap. This help Smoochum determine if it likes the object or not.\nWhen walking, Smoochum rocks its head back and forth. Smoochum is known to be very curious. This Pok\u00e9mon is very active and runs about, although it often falls. Being very conscious of its appearance, it will check its reflection when given the chance to make sure it is not dirty. It will bathe the instant it finds any dirt on its face. However, it doesn't mind if its body get dirty. Smoochum is found living in cities and cold caverns. Smoochum is a female-only species, with no male counterpart.",

Two rows of stripes are near the marking, with the pattern continuing around its lower back. Its legs are black, and its feet are rounded and toeless.\nElekid tends to become restless and full-on rowdy when it hears the sound of thunderstorm coming, and likes to play out in the middle of thunderstorms. It can generate electricity by rotating its arms, but it tires easily and can only charge a small amount. Elekid cannot store the electricity it generates, so it prefers to break into the houses of humans in order to consume electricity from their electrical outlets. It lives in the grasslands.",

Its head is covered with large lumps, and it has a rounded, yellow beak. There is a single spike on its back and it has a tapered tail. Its short arms have three clawed fingers, while its feet have only two clawed toes.\nMagby can breathe 1100\u00a0\u00b0F (600\u00a0\u00b0C) flames, and hot embers drip from its mouth. Its health can be determined by these flames; yellow flames show that a Magby is in good health, while flames mixed with a lot of smoke is symptomatic of fatigue, and flames dripping from its nose is a sign of a cold. Magby's volcanic habitat ensures its health. However, it can be seen living in towns. Magby is known to be rather small and timid. It leaks out flames when excited or surprised. It prefers to soak in the magma of volcanoes in order to recover from the day's fatigue.",

A black hood-like marking surrounds its face with a pink, triangular mark on its forehead. There are two small horns on top of its head. It has large, blue eyes, a black nose, and a wide mouth, as well as long, black, floppy ears with yellow insides. Miltank has a yellow udder with four pink teats. All four of its limbs end in black, cloven hooves, and its long tail is tipped with a black sphere. In The Young Flame Strikes Back! , a smaller Miltank was shown without any horns or teats, implying that this is what young Miltank look like.\nIn every generation except for Generations VI and VII , Milk Drink is the signature move of Miltank. Prior to Generation VI, Miltank was the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Milk Drink. The milk that it produces is sweet and very nutritious, and can be used to heal Pok\u00e9mon and ill or weary humans. Drinking a large amount of Miltank's milk will cause the Pok\u00e9mon or person to gain weight and develop stomach pains. The taste and nutrition of its milk improves with the quality of the pastures it lives in, and the taste itself changes with the season. It can produce over five gallons of milk per day, which in turn can be turned into yogurt or enjoyed unchanged by children and adults alike. Miltank can become ill if it is not milked every day. Miltank lives in grasslands , and is also raised on farms. Miltank has been supporting the lives of people and other Pok\u00e9mon since ancient times with its ability to produce milk.",

Eating a Blissey's egg is said to bring good fortune to those who have consumed it. Blissey's egg can fetch the highest price at markets. Blissey can use its fluffy fur to sense sadness and will rush to anyone feeling sad or ill and attempt to nurse them back to health. Blissey is said to be overflowing with love. Blissey is a female-only species with no male counterpart. An urban Pok\u00e9mon , it is rarely seen in the wild. In Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus , if the player is injured, any nearby Blissey will approach the player and will wait nearby, only fleeing after the player has recovered to full health.

It has a thin, light blue tail with sharp angles and a spark-shaped formation at the end. Most of its face consists of thick, white fur and shorter yellow fur around its red eyes. Raikou's muzzle is a light blue \"X\" and it has a black faceplate with two bumps that cover its forehead, nose, and ears. Raikou has two long fangs that make its appearance similar to the saber-toothed cat . Its large claws each converge to form a single point and never retract. Extra fur hangs off its body in front of its thighs. Raikou has a mane across its back that resembles dull purple rain clouds and allows it to shoot bolts of lightning.\nA proverb claims that Raikou descended from the sky with a lightning bolt. Raikou is able to fly by creating storm clouds, as depicted in the Pok\u00e9mon Ranger: Guardian Signs (animated special) . In The Legend of Thunder! , Raikou is shown to be distrustful of humans, though it may form some friendship with those who help it. Raikou tends to appear during thunderstorms and when other Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon are in danger. Raikou is said to represent the speed of lightning and can control storm clouds at will. Raikou races across grasslands while barking cries that sound like thunder. Raikou's cries can also send shock waves in the air while shaking the ground at the same time. Raikou loves Raikou Treats made by Snacksworth , who once encountered and raced up a mountain with it in the past. Raging Bolt bears a resemblance to Raikou. According to Occulture, Raging Bolt is believed to be an ancestor of Raikou.\nAs mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , while Raikou is sleeping, its breath makes a rumbling sound similar to distant thunder. The moment Raikou awakens, it will quickly travel the lands, with a roar sounding similar to a crashing thunder. Raikou is known to enjoy eating Raikou Biscuits. Raikou can be lured over to a sleeping spot using the Raikou Incense. Raikou has three different sleep styles it sleeps in, they are called Energy-Storing Sleep , Meditative Sleep , and Lightning Sleep .",

It is covered in brown fur and a long, light gray cloud of smoke running along its entire back. It has gray plates on either side of the cloud and a plate beneath the cream belly fur on its chest. Entei has gray paws with brown pads and black cuff-like bands on its legs. Both front paws house three small, white retractable claws, which can be seen in battle or in Pok\u00e9mon Camp . Its main faceplate is red and shaped like fins or a six-sided star. A gray plate, resembling a horseshoe mustache, covers its muzzle. It also has a yellow crest with three sloped points on its forehead and red eyes.\nIt is said that an Entei is born whenever a new volcano appears, and that whenever Entei roars, a volcano erupts somewhere in the world. Entei races across grasslands at high speeds. It does this due to being unable to contain its extreme power. Entei is believed to represent the passion of magma, and is claimed to be the bringer of the summer's warmth. Entei can unleash massive bursts of fire capable of destroying anything it touches. Its fire is said to be hotter than the magma of a volcano. Entei loves Entei Treats made by Snacksworth , who once ran into and chased it in the past. Gouging Fire shares a resemblance to Entei. It is theorized to be an ancient Entei regenerated from a fossil.\nAs mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Entei is known to sometimes leak flames from its mouth. It also leaks flames while it sleeps as well. After taking a good rest, Entei will sweep across the land, expelling waves of fire similar to an erupting volcano. Entei is known to enjoy eating Entei Biscuits. Entei can be lured over to a sleeping spot using the Entei Incense. Entei has three different sleep styles it sleeps in, they are called Energy-Storing Sleep , Meditative Sleep , and Volcano Sleep .",

It travels across grasslands in search of water to purify by following the north wind. Northern winds always seem to blow stronger in its presence. In Pok\u00e9mon Crystal , Suicune is said to be the closest of the Legendary beasts to Ho-Oh and shares a cooperative bond with the Unown . Suicune's personality is said to be heroic, serious, and calm during dangerous situations, as depicted in Drifloon On the Wind! . Suicune is believed to be both the embodiment of the north winds and compassion of pure spring waters.

Red scales cover its diamond-shaped belly, and there are several small diamond-shaped holes in its body. Its short arms lack fingers, while its feet have a single toenail each. It has a tail with a conical center surrounded by a ring of plate-like scales, causing it to resemble a tunnel-boring machine.\nLarvitar is born deep underground, far from its parent. It emerges to the surface and grows by consuming soil, and it will enter its pupal stage upon eating an entire mountain's worth of earth. This pupal stage is an evolution called Pupitar . Larvitar usually lives in mountains , hills, and caves. It adapts poorly to bright lights. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , it is possible to find a Larvitar holding a half-eaten clump of earth while it sleeps. It is believed this is due to Larvitar falling asleep after filling its belly.",

The upper portion of its body is covered by a mask-like plate with four large spikes on either side. Three additional spikes protrude from its forehead, and another pair of spikes are visible on either side of its lower body.\nWhile its arms and legs are developing inside the shell, Pupitar uses compressed gas to propel itself around, and can generate enough force to knock down mountains. Pupitar even performs this technique even when it sleeps. Pupitar lives and moves freely around harsh mountain ranges. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Pupitar is known to move around even when sleeping. [1]",

            "description": "Tyranitar is a large, bipedal, dinosaurian Pok\u00e9mon with a green, armor-like hide covering its body. It has two pairs of pointed teeth: one in the upper jaw and one in the lower. Several spikes of varying sizes protrude from the back of its head, neck, and shoulders. Both sides of its chest, the center of its back, and its knees have two triangular holes. There is a gray, diamond-shaped patch of scales covering its belly and a smaller one on its back. It has three claws on its feet and hands. A ring of spikes surrounds the tip of its tail.\nTyranitar is a powerful Pok\u00e9mon with an insolent nature, uncaring of others. It is extremely strong, and its thick, rocky hide gives it good resistance to all forms of attack. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Tyranitar sleeps with no fear thanks to this overwhelming power and strong body. As it is not worried about surroundings even in its sleep, Tyranitar can be seen sleeping in an amazing sleeping position with its limbs open wide. As a result, Tyranitar is always looking for a battle and will not flinch at anything, though it ignores opponents that it thinks are not worth its time. Tyranitar's power is so devastating that it can forcefully crush anything using one of its hands. If enraged, Tyranitar sets off outstanding earthquakes that can completely change the entire landscape, destroying houses and mountains, and often forcing cartographers to draw up new maps. It lives in nests made from demolished mountains . In the Galar region , it has a fierce rivalry with Duraludon , which it shares its habitat with, often battling each other in the mountains. Iron Thorns is believed to be a relative of Tyranitar from one billion years in the future.\nPrior to Generation IV , Sand Stream was Tyranitar's signature Ability .",

It has a ridged mouth similar to a beak, although it has pointed teeth on its lower jaw. Its head has a point to the back, and Lugia's eyes have pointed blue or black spikes on them. Lugia has a long, slender neck and a smooth, streamlined body. Dark blue or black plate-like protrusions run down the length of its back, and there are two smaller, more pointed ones on the end of its tail.\nLugia can fold back these plates to increase its speed. Lugia is covered in many scales that protect it from attacks . It has large wings that resemble hands. Though it is gender unknown, as depicted in The Mystery is History , a young Lugia has been seen, suggesting there is a breeding population, at least in the animated series timeline . In the same episode, Lugia has been shown to be fiercely protective of its young. Lugia leads the legendary birds . When they fight over territory, Lugia is the only Pok\u00e9mon that can quell their ceaseless fighting, as observed in the second Pok\u00e9mon movie .\nMuch like the birds, it possesses the ability to control the weather; most notably, it can calm and give rise to storms. It is said that a light flutter of its wings is capable of causing winds powerful enough to tear a regular house down. If it were to flap its wings, it could hypothetically spawn storms lasting as long as forty days. Lugia is capable of splitting islands like the Whirl Islands into smaller islands. It is highly intelligent, and because of the devastating power it could accidentally inflict, it isolates itself deep underwater and tends to sleep in solitude. It is extremely rare and is hardly ever seen. Lugia has been referred to as the \" guardian of the seas \". There are rumors Lugia would appear during the night of a storm. Lugia loves Lugia Treats made by Snacksworth , who once encountered it in the past.\nLugia is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Aeroblast .\nA unique variant of Lugia that has jagged silver eye-spikes, a dark-purple body with white undersides, and glowing red eyes. It also has sharper toes that resemble claws, as well as a longer, more pointed tongue. Additionally, due to the shape of Lugia's back plates on its 3D models being changed after Generation IV , Shadow Lugia now possesses a unique design for them.\nShadow Lugia is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Shadow Blast .",

The rare few who bear witness to Ho-Oh are promised eternal happiness. Ho-Oh used to perch at the top of the various towers located across the Johto region: the Bell Tower until the Brass Tower was destroyed by fire and the Goldenrod Tower in ancient times. It now presumably flies through the world's skies in search of a Trainer with a pure heart. Ho-Oh loves Ho-Oh Treats made by Snacksworth, who once witnessed it flying over him in the past.",

Treecko's hands and feet each have three digits covered with tiny spikes. These spikes allow it to scale vertical walls with ease. Its stomach and throat are red. It also has a line across its stomach resembling a pouch. Treecko has a large, dark green tail with two separate lobes that it uses to sense humidity. This ability allows it to predict the next day's weather.\nTreecko is rarely found in the wild and is more common in captivity. However, when in the wild, Treecko lives inside overgrown forests . It makes its home in tall trees and will attack anyone that comes near its nest. Because of its territorial nature, it is known to be the protector of the forest's trees. Treecko is known for its calm and collected personality. It will never panic under any circumstances, even when faced with a bigger foe. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy .",

            "description": "Torchic is a small, chick Pok\u00e9mon with stubby, downy, yellow wings. Its body is covered with orange feathers and a fluffy coat of down. There is an orange and yellow crest on its head that resembles a flame. Its two thin legs and short beak are a light brownish yellow, and the feet have three toes in front and one in the back. A male Torchic will have a small black speck on its rear that is not present in females.\nWithin Torchic's belly, this Pok\u00e9mon has a flame sac filled with a burning fire. This internal flame causes Torchic to feel warm if hugged. The warmth feels similar to a warm water bottle. As long as Torchic is alive, the internal flame will burn continuously. When attacked, it will shoot fireballs of 1,800\u00a0\u00b0F (1,000\u00a0\u00b0C) at its foes, leaving them scorched black. It dislikes darkness, as it cannot see its surroundings. Torchic will follow its Trainer with unsteady steps. While Torchic is rarely found in the wild, it is known to inhabit grasslands . It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy .",

An orange, pointed design adorns the center of its waist at the dividing line of the two colors. It has orange eyes and a short, wide beak. There is a feather crest on top of its head with three orange points. This crest is smaller on female Combusken. Its tail is short and pointed. It has three, sharp claws at the ends of its long arms, and scaly, gray legs with well-developed thighs covered in shaggy feathers.\nThe legs of Combusken possess an equal amount of speed and power. Because of the training Combusken does by running through its grassland habitat, these legs are capable of delivering a barrage of kicks. Its kicks are said to have outstanding destructive power. Combusken can unleash up to 10 kicks per second. While it is fighting, it is noisy and produces sharp cries that distract and intimidate its opponent. During battles, Combusken's internal flame will burn and become stronger.",

Behind its head, there are beige, hair-like feathers that continue downward and surround its chest and abdomen. It has a small red face with a V-shaped crest on its head. Blaziken's blue eyes are semicircular with yellow sclerae, and its mouth is similar to a hooked beak. It has featherless, gray hands with three fingers each, and three clawed toes that are not normally visible due to the shaggy, yellow feathers on the bottom of its legs. A female has a shorter mask and hair than a male.\nBlaziken has a courageous personality. Blaziken has strong, muscular legs that give it great lower body strength. This lower body strength helps its kicking and jumping abilities. Its jumps are powerful enough to jump over a 30-story building in a single leap. Blaziken's wrists have gray wristband-like markings capable of producing a tuft of fire above them. Blaziken can also make flames spout from its ankles. This allows it to cloak its feet or fists, and it uses these abilities while practicing a form of martial art . Its flames burn more intensely when it faces stronger opponents. The blazing punches of Blaziken can leave its foes scorched and blackened. Every several years, its old feathers burn off, and new, supple feathers grow back in their place. While Blaziken is rarely found in the wild, it is known to inhabit grasslands .\nIn Generation III , Blaze Kick was its signature move .",

Mudkip is capable of moving or crushing boulders larger than itself. Its large tail fin provides powerful acceleration to propel it through the water. According to its Pok\u00e9mon Ranger browser entry, Mudkip is a very docile Pok\u00e9mon. Mudkip is more commonly found in captivity, though it can be found in swamps and other wetlands . In the wild, it sleeps by burying itself in the mud soil at the water's edge or bottom of a river. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy .",

Marshtomp's head has an angular black fin, orange eyes, and orange gills on the ends of both cheeks. It has long arms with three-fingered hands. Its feet have three small toes, and it has two black fins for tails.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon has a thin, sticky film enveloping its body that enables it to live on land. This development came from living on muddy ground where there is poor footing. Despite this, Marshtomp is at its best when in this environment. Its body weakens if its skin dries out, so it plays in the mud on beaches when the tide is low to replenish fluids. It is capable of moving faster through mud than water. With its sturdy legs, it has a good footing in mud that allows it to overwhelm struggling opponents. Marshtomp lives in swamps and other wetlands .\nIn Generation III , Muddy Water was its signature move .",

Swampert is semi-bipedal. It can stand on its three-toed feet with a hunched posture, and pick up or grab objects with its hands, but when moving about it tends to run on all four limbs. It has orange conical gills that protrude from round patches on either side of its face. Two large fan-like black fins extend from the top of its orange eyes to the back of its head. Similarly, a black fan-like tail fin extends upward from its hindquarters. Swampert is predominantly cobalt with a white abdomen, orange gills, and similarly orange padding on all four limbs.\nSwampert boasts the physical strength to easily drag an enormous boulder weighing more than a ton, batter down opponents, and swim faster than a jet ski. It can even tow a large ship while swimming. Swampert's arms are as hard as rocks. The arms can shatter enormous boulders to pieces. It has keen eyesight, enabling it to see in murky waters. Swampert also can predict storms, sensing subtle differences in the sounds of waves and tidal winds with its fins. When a storm is approaching, Swampert will pile up boulders to protect its nest. It makes its nests on beautiful beaches . The reason Swampert covers itself in mud is that it wants to keep its skin moist. It has also been seen living on beautiful beaches.\nIn Generation III , Muddy Water was its signature move .",

It takes a bite at anything that moves and makes the hair on its tail bristle out to try to intimidate its foes. Poochyena's vigorous barking attempt at opponents embodies Poochyena's cowardly nature. Known for its tenacious nature, it chases after prey alongside the pack until the victim becomes exhausted. If its victim strikes back, then it may turn tail. It is omnivorous and will eat anything. This Pok\u00e9mon lives in grasslands, savannas , and forests .",

            "description": "Mightyena is a mammalian Pok\u00e9mon that strongly resembles a cross between a canine and a hyena. Its fur is mostly short and gray, but its lower legs, tail, and two thick shaggy strips starting behind its eyes and running the length of its body are black. It has dark, triangular streak patterns below its eyes, which are red with yellow sclerae. Its ears are rhombus-shaped with dark insides, its nose is red, and it has gray paw pads.\nMightyena gives obvious signals when it is about to attack, as it starts to growl deeply and flattens its body. Mightyena travels and lives as a pack in the wild, consisting of around ten individuals. Once a Mightyena targets a prey, it will never allow it to escape. The pack chases prey and defeats foes with perfectly coordinated teamwork. The pack can also howl in unison to send information to allies from far away. Mightyena living in a pack follows a strict hierarchy, and will always follow the orders of their leader. This instinct also compels Mightyena to obey only the most experienced of Trainers . As depicted in the movie Zoroark: Master of Illusions , Mightyena is prone to licking the faces of the people it's fond of. This species lives in grasslands and savannas . In Lental , Mightyena preys on Furret .",

It has a brown head with spiky ears and a black nose. A black mask-like pattern surrounds its brown eyes. The upper half of its mouth is jagged, and when it is open, there are two pointed teeth in its lower jaw. Its feet have three claws and pink paw pads. Its fore feet are cream-colored, but the hind feet are brown. Its brush tail is spiky and bristly.\nZigzagoon is abundantly curious, as it wanders restlessly back and forth while rubbing its nose to the ground in search of something. It always moves in a zigzag fashion, and leaves behind distinct zigzag footprints as it runs. It rubs its bristly back hair against trees to mark its territory and plays dead to fool opponents in battle. The Zigzagoon found outside of Galar are friendlier and calmer compared to their Galarian relatives. Zigzagoon are capable of finding items in the grass or ground , including items that were lost. It is found commonly in grassy fields .",

One long stripe stretches the length of its body before ending in an arrowhead shape on its forehead. There are additional stripes on each side of its bushy tail and on its cheeks. It has sharp, elongated claws and small pointed teeth. It has small, tuft-like ears, long cheek fur, and blue eyes.\nLinoone can run up to 60 miles per hour , but it can only run in a straight line, and has to stop before it can make a turn. Because of this behavior, it often fails to catch prey, and struggles on roads that are curving or winding. When it sees prey underwater in ponds, it leaps in and uses its razor-sharp claws to catch and take it down. Linoone's fur is strong and supple, and the shed hairs are used to make high-quality shaving brushes. As shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Showdown at Linoone , Linoone has an attraction to anything round and will grab any orb-shaped object it sees if given the chance. It often carries a snatched object in its expandable cheek pouches and deposits it in any of a number of secret stashes it keeps on its territory. Linoone tends to live in grasslands .",

It can spit white silk that turns gooey when exposed to the air. To defend itself, it can release poison from its tail spikes, which can weaken foes. Wurmple's diet consist of leaves and sap, the latter of which it gets by pulling bark off trees. Wurmple are abundant and live in forests .

A pair of red eyes can be seen through the holes, but they are partially hidden by a rough fringe of silk. The silk forms a hard cocoon that it can use to repel enemy attacks. Dew and rainwater collect on the silk, which provides Silcoon with nourishment.\nSilcoon lives in forests , where it conserves energy by moving as little as possible. This energy, which it had gathered as a Wurmple , serves as fuel for its further Evolution. Due to its cocoon, Silcoon cannot extend its limbs and can only move really slowly. However, its eyes allow it to be on the lookout for danger.",

The upper pair of wings are larger and have a line of yellow along the top edge, while each of the lower wings has a long, round-tipped extension on the bottom. The female's wings have smaller red spots than the male's.\nBeautifly has a long and curled black proboscis that it uses to gather pollen and nectar \u2014 its favorite food \u2014 from flowers. Its diet also includes water, fruit juices, and bodily fluids from its prey, all of which it sucks up with its proboscis. Despite its appearance, Beautifly is known to be aggressive and greedy; it will jab at foes with its proboscis if it is disturbed while collecting pollen. The preferred habitats of a Beautifly are forests , where it rides the spring winds while searching for pollen. It competes with Combee for nectar.",

Additionally, it camouflages itself by attaching dead leaves to its body. As its cells create energy for Evolution , the inside of the cocoon becomes hot.

Its tattered, green wings are wide and flat, forming a disc-shape around its body. They have red markings in the form of rings and streaks, a darker green line around the edges, and contain toxic dust. This Pok\u00e9mon has two pairs of red, stubby legs and yellow, stylized compound eyes. There is a pair of fuzzy, yellow antennae on top of Dustox's head, which are smaller on the female. These antennae are used to seek food.\nDustox is nocturnal and is instinctively drawn to light. Swarms are attracted by the bright light of cities, where they wreak havoc by devouring the leaves off roadside trees. When attacked, Dustox unleashes toxic scales from its wings; these toxins are powerful enough to make even a pro wrestler sick. As a result, people often have a difficult time driving Dustox swarms away from settlements. It lives in forests , fields and mountains.",

The leaf can stay clean even after transporting Pok\u00e9mon covered in mud. However, the leaf will wilt if Lotad becomes dehydrated. Its size and weight prevent Lotad from living on land, but, on rare occasions, it travels on land in search of clean water. Lotad is known to gather in lakes of good water quality.

Very mischievous, this Pok\u00e9mon will tug on fishing lines from underwater and pop out to startle people. It feeds on aquatic moss that grows on rocks in the riverbed. Lombre prefers living in waterfronts that contain plenty of food.

Ludicolo has black eyes surrounded by a patch of green and an orange bill. Its body is covered with shaggy yellow fur and has several zigzagging brown stripes. The female has thinner stripes than the male. Ludicolo has large green hands with two black lines on its palms, and thick green legs with a black circle on the underside of its feet.\nLudicolo becomes more powerful when it hears festive music and will appear near laughing children on hikes. The reason is due to structures in Ludicolo's body that can produce energy when hit by sound waves with a cheerful rhythm. As it becomes more energetic and active, it will break into a dance. This allows Ludicolo to face enemies without fear. Being the result of evolution via Evolution stone , Ludicolo is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found near the water's edge .\nPrior to Generation V , Ludicolo and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Rain Dish as an Ability .",

It has a gray \"cap\" with a short stem on top of its head. The stem is used to hang from tree branches in its forest home . While hanging, this Pok\u00e9mon absorbs moisture and nutrients from the tree until it becomes too heavy and falls to the ground. The more it drinks, the glossier its body becomes. Additionally, Seedot polishes itself with leaves once daily. If it remains still, it can be mistaken for a nut and startles others by moving suddenly. It also uses this strategy to be taken by bird Pok\u00e9mon to expand on its habitat. Pidgey is a natural predator of Seedot.",

This Pok\u00e9mon is mostly brown with a beige mask marking on its face. Its bulky thighs are also beige and have thin striations, and there are what appear to be two nipples on its chest. It has thin arms with mitten-like hands. If its long, pointed nose is grabbed, Nuzleaf will lose its power. The nose serves functions as a sensory.\nUsing the leaf on its head as a flute, it makes music with leaves that create a sense of unease in people. However, it can also play comforting melodies. Nuzleaf lives in tropical forests and is skilled at climbing, but it will come out of the forest to frighten people. Nuzleaf uses a sound similar to a grass tune to warn wandering intruders.\nIn Generation III , Extrasensory was its signature move , but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .",

This Pok\u00e9mon's feet resemble Japanese tengu-geta . Three broad leaves with brown spokes form each of its hands and are used to create powerful winds close to 100 feet (30 meters) per second in speed. A female will have smaller leaves than a male.\nShiftry is a wicked, mysterious, and very rare Pok\u00e9mon that lives atop ancient trees in deep tropical forests . It arrives with freezing winds and is feared by people as the guardian of the forest. It is said that when Shiftry does this, the winter season will arrive. It can read an opponent's mind and then take preemptive action. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Jump for Joy! , it was shown to lead large groups of Seedot and Nuzleaf . Folklore states that Shiftry was once an evil bird Pok\u00e9mon before its wings and beak were replaced as punishment for its misdemeanor.",

Two sharply pointed feathers form its tail.\nTaillow is very gutsy and will stand up to powerful opponents without backing down. During the cold season, this Pok\u00e9mon will fly over 180 miles (300 kilometers) per day to search for areas that have warm climates . It typically hunts Wurmple , but flocks have also been shown eating crops in the Pok\u00e9mon Chronicles episode We're No Angels! . When it is hungry, it will weaken and cry loudly.",

Three blue-tipped feathers give it a fan-like tail and its small, orange feet have two webbed toes. Wingull has long, flat wings with light blue stripes near the tips.\nWingull has hollow bones, which makes it light enough to fly. By extending its wings, it can catch updrafts and glide across the sky. Wingull folds its wings only when it is resting. It builds its nests on steep cliffs by the sea , and habitually hides prey and valuables in various locations using its beak, especially during winter season. Wingull's main predators are Talonflame , which attacks and catches them with powerful kicks; and Barraskewda , which leaps out and bites any Wingull flying too close to the water's surface. It circles above oceans looking for its favorite food, Wishiwashi , to eat. It also loves to eat Finneon who jump up on the sea surface. Fishermen use Wingull's skill to locate areas teeming with fish Pok\u00e9mon.",

Its large yellow bill appears to extend along its underside.\nInside Pelipper's bill is a throat pouch that it uses to carry Eggs and small Pok\u00e9mon such as its own young and Pyukumuku , and is large enough to fit a small child in. Due to this, Pelipper is often compared to a courier or a messenger. Skimming across the top of waves, it scoops food from the sea and swallows it in one gulp. It can swallow up to 30 Wishiwashi in one go, and loves to eat abandoned Luvdisc that are too despondent to be wary near the sea surface. It builds its nest on steep cliffs facing the sea . Young male Pelipper are in charge of gathering food and bringing it back to others at its nest. Pelipper rests its wings while floating in the ocean.",

There is a wispy extension trailing off the back of its feet, creating the overall impression of a nightgown or oversized dress. Most of its face is covered by green hair that resembles a bowl cut , but a pair of pinkish-red eyes is sometimes visible. There are two flat, red horns on top of its head: a large one toward the front and a smaller one at the back.\nRalts uses the horns to read people and Pok\u00e9mon's emotions. Warm feelings cause its body to warm as well, but it hides if it senses hostility. If its Trainer is in a cheerful mood, Ralts also becomes cheerful and joyous. It is known to inhabit urban areas , but it does not normally show itself to humans. However, when it senses happy feelings, it will approach people. Ralts prefers to hang out with people of cheerful nature more than those with gloomy natures. Regardless, Ralts will show no discrimination to anyone based on age or gender. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , when you see a Ralts smiling in its sleep, that means something good has happened during that day. [1]",

Beneath the ruffles, it has skinny green legs with long, pointed feet. Its arms are also thin with two digits each. It has green hair that covers most of its face and reaches its shoulders on either side, resembling two ponytails . Large, red eyes are visible on either side of the hair that covers its face. On each side of its head is a flat, crimson horn that resembles a hairpin.\nKirlia's horns are used to amplify its psychokinetic power and distort the air around it. The distortion in the air causes scenery mirages and can cause a rip in dimensions. This ability also allows Kirlia to see into the future. It enjoys dancing on sunny mornings, and grows beautiful when exposed to a Trainer with positive emotions. Kirlia inhabits urban areas . As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Kirlia is known to dance while it sleeps. The reason is due to Kirlia having a premonition of a fun future in its dreams.",

It has long arms with three fingers on each hand and slender white legs. A red, fin-like horn extends from its chest, and a shorter, more rounded horn extends from the back. A band of green on its chest extends to the center of the front horn and connects to its sleeve-like arms.\nGardevoir is able to see the future using its psychic powers. Its telekinetic powers enable it to lift objects and support itself without feeling the pull of gravity. Additionally, it is able to create small black holes, distort dimensions, and fire a destructive energy wave . Gardevoir's power reaches its peak when protecting its Trainer , whom it will protect with its life. This Pok\u00e9mon typically inhabits urban areas , but has occasionally been sighted in snowy regions. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Gardevoir often sleeps upright in order to protect people or Pok\u00e9mon instantly at any moment.

It has a round body with four long, skinny legs extending from it. On top of its head is a yellow cap with a single antenna that secretes a thick, sugary syrup or a sweet scent. The syrup is exuded as a defense mechanism, while the scent can attract prey. This Pok\u00e9mon can also secrete oil from the tips of its feet, which enables it to walk on water as though skating.\nSurskit inhabits ponds, rivers, and similar wetlands , where it feeds on microscopic, aquatic organisms. It's also known to appear in puddles after rainstorms. In its natural habitat, Surskit has been known to compete with Dewpider over food.",

The antennae are white with pink along the lower rim. White lines along the rim resemble eyelashes, while a large, dark pink dot in the middle represents the pupil or iris. These eyespots are used to intimidate enemies.\nMasquerain's four wings allow it to fly in any direction and hover, but it cannot fly when its wings are wet. As shown in its official artwork and the TCG , the wings are translucent. Additionally, rainy weather causes its antennae to become heavy and droop. In order to protect its wings and antennae, this Pok\u00e9mon will shelter under trees or the eaves of houses. Masquerain lives on water's edge.",

Additionally, it has light, springy footwork that allows it to get close to opponents. Another way it closes in on opponents is by incapacitating them with spores released from the holes in its cap. Its technique is equal to that of professional boxers.

There is a scruff of fur on top of its head, and it has a large pink pig -like snout, pink eyelids, and dark rings around its eyes. It has long, lanky arms, but shorter legs. Each paw has two sharp claws, and there are pink paw pads on the back feet. Its underbelly and rear are also pink.\nSlakoth lolls around and sleeps for more than twenty hours a day, which can make those around it drowsy. Since it does not move very much, it does not need much food and only eats three leaves each day. Its heart only beats once a minute. In Generation III , Slack Off was its signature move . It makes its nest in tropical forests , and keeps the same one during its entire life. However, it can travel far by swimming in rivers. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Drowsy Power is the only thing that make Slakoth move in order sleep near Snorlax . [1]\nPrior to Generation V and in Generation IX , Slakoth and its fully evolved form, Slaking , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Truant as an Ability .",

Its arms are long, and its hands and feet have two sharp black claws. The undersides of its hands and feet have circular red pads, and its rear also has a baboon-like patch of red. The fur on its chest, tail, and sides of its maw are shaggy.\nVigoroth's heart beats ten times faster than it did as a Slakoth , and as such, it cannot sit still for even a minute. Attempting to stand still or sleep raises its stress level and agitates its blood. It likes to go berserk by spinning its arms to destroy anything in its path. It runs wild through the jungle. Due to its rampages, it is always hungry. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , despite Vigoroth appearing to be fast alseep at first glance, it is unable to sleep deeply. [1]",

It can exert a lot of power by releasing built-up energy all at once and is said to be feared for its immense strength. Slaking lives in tropical forests , where it feeds on grass and ripened fruit that falls from trees. It only moves around when there is no more food within reach for it to eat. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , it is rare to see Slaking dozing off while consuming the grass around it. [1]\nIn Generation III , Slack Off was its signature move .

As it is virtually blind, it uses its antennae to sense its surroundings. On its back is a pair of small, green wings. Its hind legs are white, but the forelegs are brown and have sharp claws.\nThe claws are used to carve into the roots of trees and absorb moisture and nutrients. Nincada builds underground nests at the roots of trees in tropical and temperate forests . It can occasionally live up to 10 years underground. It does not like sunlight, so it avoids it. Nincada is nearly blind due to living almost entirely underground, as such, it uses its antennae to see instead.",

            "description": "Ninjask is a small, cicada-like Pok\u00e9mon with two pairs of wings. Its body is mostly black with accents of yellow and gray. Most of its head is yellow, but there is a solid band of black between its gleaming red eyes. The band expands into a circular pattern on its forehead, between two pointed crests on the sides of its head. The underside of its head is gray and segmented, making it somewhat resemble a veil. On its back is a patch of black with a stretch of yellow, shaped like an upside-down letter Y. Most of its carapace and abdomen is black, but there is a ring of yellow near the tip. Its gray insectoid arms extend from its chest and usually have their small, yellow claws turned inward. There is a similar pair of back legs. It has large, veined wings with triangular, red tipping.\nNinjask is a very fast Pok\u00e9mon that is said to be able to evade any attack and was long believed to be invisible due to its high speed. If it is not trained properly, it will refuse to obey its Trainer and cry loudly. Due to this, it is said to put the Trainer's abilities to the test. Hearing its loud cries for too long induces a headache. It lives in tropical and temperate forests , where it congregates around tree sap to feed.",

It has four protrusions on its underside instead of legs; the top pair is brown, while the lower is gray. There are round protrusions on the side of its head with narrow slits for eyes. Two lines encircle its abdomen and a white crescent-shaped halo floats above its head. On its back is a pair of tattered wings divided into three wingtips. A hole between its wings reveals that its body is completely hollow and dark, as it possesses no internal organs.\nShedinja is said to be a very strange and peculiar Pok\u00e9mon due to how it is created from an empty shell. It has the ability to inhabit an empty Pok\u00e9 Ball after it evolves from Nincada . It is said that looking into this empty space will steal one's spirit. Its shell is very hard, which gives it strong defense but renders it incapable of movement. It does not breathe and floats without moving its wings. It lives in tropical and temperate forests .\nShedinja is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Wonder Guard as an Ability .",

It has stubby arms and yellow-tipped feet that lack toes and have plus-shaped markings underneath. Above its small, plug-like tail is a yellow, crescent marking. There is a hole in the center of its tail.\nWhismur are a timid species, being easily frightened by loud noises. Whismur's murmurs are barely audible, but when it senses danger, it lets out an ear-splitting cry as loud as a jet plane taking off. The cry of a Whismur is about 100 decibels and can cause an all-day headache should anyone be near it. Startled by its own cries, it will cry louder. When it finally stops crying, it will fall asleep from exhaustion. Because it breathes through its ear canals, it can cry continually. However, it will stop crying if its ear covers are shut. Whismur lives in caves .",

When its mouth is open, its large tongue and throat are visible. Above its prominent mouth is a stubby nose. On top of its head are two short stalks that support its circular ears. The inside of its ears have alternating black and purple rings, but there is only a single black ring on the back. There are yellow stripes on its back in a pattern that resembles sound waves. It has arms with three fingers and short legs with two peg-like toes. On the sole of each foot is a yellow circle.\nLoudred is able to shout at high volumes by inhaling, then exhaling using powerful stomach muscles. Additionally, its round ears serve as loudspeakers and it will stomp its feet to build power. Its powerful voice can tip trucks, splinter wooden houses, and blow away its opponents, but it will be temporarily deaf when it finishes shouting. Loudred can be found in caves .",

It has protruding tubes with holes along its body: seven forming a crest on top of its head, one on each elbow and knee, two along its back, and one at the end of each of its two tails. The tubes along its head-crest and tails are tipped with yellow, while the ones along its back have yellow semicircular patterns on either side. There are two yellow semicircle markings on its belly, but they are rarely seen due to its giant mouth. Its arms have three thin stripes below its elbow and three fingers. Each foot has four claws, three in the front and one in the back, and a yellow paw pad.\nExploud uses the tubes on its body to draw in air and increase its noise-based attacks. Its bellowing is capable of triggering earthquakes and can be heard from over six miles away. While it only raises its voice when it is in battle, it can also communicate its feelings to others by producing whistle-like sounds. In the past, Exploud was used by distant cities as a way of communication. It lives in caves .",

Energy is built into its body each time it rises back up. Broken trees often surround its nest, because it trains by slapping and slamming into them. It is known to mistake Exeggutor for a tree, and often gets flung away as a result. This Pok\u00e9mon eats lots of food and gets plenty of sleep.

It likes to match power with other big-bodied Pok\u00e9mon and can stomp the ground to build its own power. Trucks can be sent flying, telephone poles broken in two, and trains can even be stopped by its powerful slapping arms. They are kindhearted and practice etiquette, praising its battle opponents.

The ball can also be used as a flotation device. It can be seen bouncing and playing on this rubbery tail. The tail can also be spun around like a lasso. When the tail is thrown, the body can go as far as 33 feet (10 meters). Though Azurill is typically docile, it swings the big ball on its tail to smash into opponents bigger than itself when angered. It lives at the water's edge , where they gather to splash around for fun on sunny days.\nPrior to Generation VI and in Generation IX , Azurill and its evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Huge Power as an Ability .",

            "description": "Nosepass is a blue, angular, hard bipedal Pok\u00e9mon that closely resembles a Moai . Its bright red, triangular nose is highly magnetic and slightly resembles a 3D arrow. This nose functions as an electromagnet and always points north. It has arms and legs without any visible joints and small, circular holes on the undersides. Its arms resemble compass needles. It has similar circular holes on the sides of its head. Its eyes, covered by dark, somewhat mask-like markings, have the appearance of being closed.\nNosepass cannot go near others, since it would repel them with its magnetic nose. Its magnetism is stronger in cold seasons. To protect itself when in danger, it raises its magnetism and draws iron objects to its body. This technique is also used to capture prey, though it can pull natural enemies close too. Because it always points north, Nosepass has historically been used as a compass for travelers. Nosepass only moves a little over 3/8 of an inch each year, but can quickly spin its body into the ground like a drill during emergency situations. It lives in caves . Metang are natural predators of Nosepass.",

It is popular among female Trainers and used in competitions for its style and sublime fur. It is nocturnal and active at dusk.

It also has a red gemstone on its chest, and its back has a blue and green gemstone as well as another red one. These gem-like eyes and adornments on its body are caused by its diet, which consists of rocks and raw gemstones. Because of this, each individual Sableye can create an infinite number of patterns on its body.\nIt also targets Carbink as prey, though they are usually taken by Gabite before Sableye can reach them. It is feared by people since it is said to steal a person's soul if they look into its eyes. It is nocturnal and is rarely seen. It lives in the darkness of caves . It uses its claws to dig for gems to eat and fight back. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Sableye is known to occasionally sleep while holding its gemstones. It is believed that Sableye dreams of eating gemstones until it feels satisfied.\nSableye is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Stall as an Ability .",

It has red eyes and a pair of long, black, ear-like extensions on either side of its head. Its legs resemble a hakama . Its most notable feature is a pair of large black jaws emerging from the back of its head. These jaws have a yellow, oval-shaped spot on their top surface. They contain ten sharp, metallic teeth - six on the top row and four on the bottom. While the jaws are actually transformed steel horns, Mawile can articulate them at will, using them to bite enemies with enough force to break an iron beam. These jaws are incapable of tasting, leading Mawile to use them to eat food it does not like.\nMawile is typically found in caves . It uses its non-threatening appearance to make foes underestimate it, then attacks with its giant jaws, sometimes swallowing its prey whole. When engaged in battle, Mawile usually has its back turned to the enemy to make better use of its jaws.",

A single, blunt spike protrudes from its back.\nAron feeds on iron ore that it digs from mountains. It uses this ore to make its body. Sometimes, hunger will drive it to descend from the mountains to eat bridges and rails, which makes it a pest. It makes a new suit of armor after evolving, while its old discarded armor is salvaged for making iron products. People have been collecting Aron's shed armor since ancient times. With one all-out charge, it can demolish even a heavy dump truck. It lives on mountains.",

Close inspection of Lairon has revealed scratches and dents left on the armor from its conflicts. It drinks nutritious mineral spring water and feeds on iron contained in rocks. However it has gotten into conflict with humans over these territories in the past. It builds its nest on mountains where iron ore is buried, which results in it clashing with humans that are iron mining.",

The armor on its head has two pairs of holes with horns protruding from the foremost holes. Its forehead plating extends past its upper jaw in a small point. It has sky-blue eyes, and two nostril-like holes on the tip of its upper jaw. On the rim of its mouth are several pointed, fang-like protrusions and the nape of its neck and back have gray-silver armor sections. It has wide, blunt spikes on its shoulders and gray-silver bands on its arms and legs. Its hands and feet each have three claws. It has a thick, long, black tail that it can swing at enemies.\nThe gouges in Aggron's armor from previous battles are worn as mementos. The more wounds it has, the more it has battled. It claims a large mountain as its territory and fiercely defends it from trespassers. If its environment is damaged by a flood or a forest fire, it will restore the area by bringing in topsoil and planting trees. It burrows through the strongest of bedrock and digs tunnels, as it searches for iron to eat. Its horns, which it uses to dig through bedrock when seeking food, grow a little longer at a time and can be used to determine its age. Aggron's horn is sharp enough to cut through steel and used as a ramming weapon to bring foes down. Long ago, there was a king who wore a helmet resembling an Aggron in an attempt to channel its strength.",

Its onion-shaped head is also white with large eyes and pink ovals on its cheeks. It has round, swirled ears on the sides of its head. These ears are higher up on a male than on a female.\nMeditite heightens its inner energy and spiritual power through meditation, which also allows it to levitate. It trains hours a day and never skips its daily yoga training. Meditite's training never ends, since it constantly loses concentration and focus while meditating. It eats one berry per day as part of training, which tempers its spirit and makes its senses sharper.

It has a small, pointed, yellow-tipped tail.\nUsing the electric charge found in its fur, Electrike stimulates its leg muscles and runs faster than the human eye can follow. It uses friction from the atmosphere to generate electricity. Because of this, its body gives off showers of sparks in seasons with arid air or before a storm.

It has a jagged upper jaw, red eyes, and holes on either side of its head that seem to be its ears. Each of its paws has three claws. Its blue, spike-like tail is bent at a sharp angle.\nManectric gathers electricity in its mane and then discharges it. This process creates thunderclouds, which it uses in battle. Since lightning falls in its vicinity, it is said to have been born from lightning and make its nest where lightning has struck. It lives in grasslands and savannas , and rarely appears in front of people.",

Two simple wings extend from the band around its shoulder. It has a blue face with yellow eyes, and curly, yellow antennae with black stripes. It has a spherical yellow tail, which glows to communicate and draw geometric patterns in the sky while in a swarm. In Generation III , Tail Glow was its signature move . This is a male only species; Illumise is its female counterpart. Volbeat is attracted by the sweet aroma given off by Illumise. It lives in forests near clean ponds, but will move if the pond becomes dirty.",

Surrounding its head are purple curls that frame its face. Its antennae are small and yellow. Its body is black with a blue belly and a yellow bid marking. Its arms and legs are black and are connected to the body by purple borders. It has small wings used for flying with others, and a pattern of three oblong yellow spots on its rear. This is a female only species; Volbeat is its male counterpart.\nIllumise uses its sweet aromas to lure in Volbeat and have them draw geometric patterns in the sky. It is said to earn respect from others by composing designs that are more complex. Over 200 different patterns have been discovered. It is a nocturnal Pok\u00e9mon that lives in forests.",

Visible from the back is a small stretch of yellow coloration around its neck much like a collar. There are leaves extending from its shoulders like epaulettes. It has a leaf skirt with a yellow stripe running down the front. A male will have a shorter leaf than a female. It holds a rose in each of its hands, a red one in its right, and a blue one in its left. However, it is said that it will occasionally have unusually colored flowers.\nRoselia's aroma brings serenity, but the thorns on its head contain a vicious poison. The more healthy it is, the more pleasant its flowers' aroma. It shoots sharp thorns at anything that tries to steal its flowers and uses different poisons in each hand when it attacks. It lives in grassy areas where it drinks nutrient-rich spring water. Roseilia's thorns are used as part of an old tradition, challenging an opponent to a duel by sending these thorns.\nIn Generation III , Grass Whistle was its signature move , but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .",

The top half of its spherical body is blue, while the bottom half is red with a yellow, four-pointed star below its mouth. It has two yellow dorsal fins above its eyes that resemble shark fins, and a matching pelvic fin on its belly. Its pectoral fins are also yellow. The caudal fin is composed of two red spines with a thin yellow membrane stretched between them.\nIt has powerful jaws and razor-sharp teeth that are able to chew through solid steel, rip up boat hulls, and rip wooden boats to pieces. As a result, sailors avoid getting their boats dented by it at all costs. Carvanha has been responsible for the destruction of many boats that come into contact with it. They mercilessly swarm any intruder and prey that invades their territory, but they become timid when alone. It only attacks when in a group of five or more, becoming instantly vicious. Carvanha is drawn towards the scent of blood. It lives in rivers that course through jungles , as well as temperate regions. Each Carvanha school has its own territory. It competes with Basculin for food.\nPrior to Generation V , Carvanha and its evolved form, Sharpedo , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Rough Skin as an Ability .",

            "description": "Sharpedo is a torpedo-shaped shark Pok\u00e9mon covered with tiny, sharp denticles . It has a large mouth filled with triangular, sharp teeth. Its eyes are a deep red color and glow in the dark. It has two gill slits situated directly behind each eye. It is mostly dark blue with a white underbelly. There is a yellow star-shaped scar on its snout, and another star-shaped scar on its rear. It has a tall dorsal fin with two notches cut into it, with a pelvic fin directly opposite it. Its two pectoral fins are arranged so that they resemble the fins on the back of a torpedo.\nSharpedo swallows and shoots out jets of seawater from its rear, which allows it to swim 75 to 80 miles per hour. However, it is unable to swim long distances. It is feared and known by many names as Bully of the Sea , Ruffian of the Seas , Bandit of the Sea , or Gangster of the Sea as a group, due to its sharp teeth. Sharpedo uses the teeth to finish off its opponent. It was once prized for its dorsal fin as a food item and has been a victim of overfishing. Its fangs can rip through iron and steel, being able to tear apart a supertanker into pieces. Sharpedo's fangs can instantly grow back the moment it comes off. Discarded Sharpedo fangs are made into accessories due to the belief they can prevent ship mishaps. It also attacks any ships that enter the waters it lives in with no exceptions. When its fangs fall out, they grow back immediately. It is very sensitive to the scent of blood. It lives in the sea. Sharpedo is known to prey on Wailmer , particularly small ones. It also preys on other Water-type Pok\u00e9mon such as Finneon , Lumineon , Lanturn , and Squirtle . In Alola , Sharpedo is used as Ride Pok\u00e9mon called Sharpedo Jet, the natives use Sharpedo to move faster in the water and destroy rocks in the water.\nPrior to Generation V , Sharpedo and its pre-evolved form, Carvanha , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Rough Skin as an Ability .",

Its back is blue with four white spots running down its spine, and two breathing nostrils on top of its head. It has two pairs of blue fins along its sides, a smaller third pair of tan fins on its rear, and a horizontal tail at the back.\nWailord is one of the largest Pok\u00e9mon to have been discovered. Due to its immense size, it can make giant splashes by jumping out of the water and then crashing back down. These shockwaves allow Wailord to knock out its opponents and herd its prey. Wailord is able to eat large quantities at one time, such as schools of Wishiwashi . However, it will flee from Wishiwashi when the latter is in its School Form.\nWailord has an easygoing temperament and loves to play. Its size causes it to have almost no natural enemies; its only known predator is Dhelmise . Wailord lives in the sea in large groups called pods. These pods, which often include Wailmer , travel together in order to search for food. When a Wailmer is attacked by its predators Sharpedo or Dhelmise, its whole pod works to defend it. Wailord can dive deep at 10,000 feet (3,000 meters) in one breath.\nWailord is popular due to its size. As a result, Wailord-watching is a favorite sightseeing activity in various parts of the world. However, Wailord are known to be driven away by fishermen when they become too numerous, so they don't eat too much fish Pok\u00e9mon.",

It uses the coal to fill the hollow spaces in its shell and then burns it for energy. Because coal is Torkoal's source of energy, it becomes weak and immobile once it runs out of coal to burn. If the fire inside of Torkoal's shell goes out, it will die. A Torkoal is healthy if the smoke spouting from its shell has tremendous velocity. When it blows out smoke from its nostrils and the top of its back, it sounds like a locomotive horn. If it is attacked, it blows black smoke out of its nostrils before fleeing. Torkoal's shell also serves to shield it from critical blows . Prior to Generation V and in Generation IX , White Smoke is its signature Ability .",

There appear to be three shining black pearls on its body: two small ones on its head, and a larger but nearly flat pearl on its midsection where the black meets the purple. These pearls are used to amplify its psychic powers, which allow it to control its opponents. The dance it performs while using its powers is very popular.

It also has a proportionally large head, small black eyes with twinkle-shaped pupils, and a zigzagging mouth.\nTrapinch's large jaws are powerful enough to crush any boulders that get in its way as it digs through the sand of the arid deserts in which it lives. It can go a week without water or food. Instead of actively hunting prey, it digs into the sand to build its bowl- or cone-shaped nests, waiting for prey to tumble inside and become trapped. When night falls, Trapinch will dig itself a spot underneath the sand and go to sleep. Due to the size of its head in contrast to its small body, Trapinch will be unable to get up after flipping over onto its back, making it vulnerable to natural predators such as Sandile .",

There are similarly-colored rhombus shapes at the end of its tail.\nVibrava's wings are not fully developed, so it is unable to fly very far. However, it is able to create vibrations and ultrasonic waves with its wings. Humans get headaches from these waves. After causing the prey to faint, as a saprotroph , it spits stomach acid to melt its prey before consumption. It continues this eating process every day to help its wings grow. Vibrava calls the desert home and is also known to preserve its captured prey in the desert's hot sands.",

Flygon's tail has several dark green stripes and three small green rhombus shapes with red trims at the end. It has large eyes and a pair of green antennae that point back. Its eyes have red covers that prevent sand from getting into them.\nWith its wings, it kicks up sandstorms to hide itself. Its wings make a \"singing\" sound when they are flapped, earning Flygon the name \"The Desert Spirit\". It uses this unique ability to attract prey, stranding them before it attacks. Flygon lives in the desert , and it typically works together with Krookodile in searching for food, whipping up sandstorms for Krookodile to hide in as they hunt, then splitting the prey that they manage to catch.",

The wings have a light and fluffy feel. It has tiny, white feet and two pointed tail feathers.\nSwablu does not like dirty surroundings, so it cleans things with its cottony wings diligently. It uses streams, freshwater springs, or a manmade shower to wash its wings when they become dirty from polishing. It is commonly found living in flocks in forested habitats , but often flies closer to towns during the spring. Swablu is very friendly and largely unafraid of humans. As a result, it frequently perches on people's heads like a fluffy hat. Swablu can easily hide from foes in clouds thanks to its appearance. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Swablu is known to sleep curled up with its wings folded. Swablu is believed to dreaming about perching atop someone's head.",

            "description": "Altaria is a blue, avian Pok\u00e9mon . Its body and cloud-like wings are covered in fluffy, white feathers. It often folds its wings behind it, obscuring its back. Two long, blue plumes extend like streamers from the back of its head. It has a short, hooked beak and prominent cheek patches, both of which are white. Additionally, it has beady, black eyes. It has a long neck and short legs protruding from its fluffy body. The feet are blue, with four toes, three claws forward, and one backward. The tail comprises five feathers, the outer two longer than the inner ones.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon uses its wings to catch updrafts and soar across the sky calmly and gracefully. It gracefully glides through the clouds, often while singing or humming in a soprano voice. Its voice seems to have special properties that induce a dreamy state for listeners. Altaria can be very affectionate, enveloping people it has bonded with in its cotton-like wings. While normally kind, Altaria can attack foes with shrill cries without mercy if provoked. As shown in the Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series episode HZ065 , Altaria's beak is strong enough to shatter boulders. According to Solana in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Pok\u00e9mon Ranger - Deoxys' Crisis! , Altaria uses geomagnetic fields to navigate their flight, and any disturbances can affect their sense of direction. Altaria is often found living in forests , though it also inhabits mountain ranges. Altaria has been shown to enjoy water in both the animated series and the TCG , although if its wings are exposed to too much of it, they lose their fluffiness, revealing their actual anatomy. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Altaria is known to sleep while wrapped inside its wings. While slepping in its soft, beautiful wings, Altaria may be enjoying the most comfortable sleep ever.",

It has two long, black claws on its forepaws, which curl underneath the forepaws when not in use, and pink paw pads on its hind feet. It has pink eyes, long ears, and a small red nose. When it opens its mouth, two sharp fangs can be seen on its upper jaw. There are small tufts of white fur on its shoulders, and it has a large, fluffy tail.\nZangoose is bitter enemies with Seviper , which it has battled for many generations. It is agile enough to easily dodge incoming threats, and it attacks foes with its sharp claws. Despite its hot-blooded and brave nature, it has been known to enjoy peaceful activities, such as listening to ocean waves. Zangoose has a strong immune system and is resistant to venom . It lives in grasslands and savannas .\nZangoose is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Toxic Boost as an Ability .

On its back are dual rocky mounds, situated to the sides of the mid-line. Its large eyes consist of thick, semicircular yellow eyelids through which black sclerae and red pupils can be seen. A black ring with six extensions surrounds each eye.\nSolrock relies on solar energy, which it absorbs in groups during daylight. While it is always expressionless, it is able to sense the emotions and thoughts of others. It spins its body to produce intense heat and a blinding light. It is able to stay silent while floating in the air and can be found in caves . It is believed Solrock originated from space, specifically the sun.",

Its eyes are very small, and it has a round, blue nose. It has several blue barbels that are used as a superb radar in murky water and can be used for taste as well. These whiskers are left exposed when it hides in the mud to wait for prey. There are two rounded, blue pectoral fins and a single dorsal fin, all of which have black spots. Its tail fin is also rounded and blue but possesses no spots.\nA slimy film covers its body, which protects Barboach from bacteria and allows it to easily escape from predators like Bird Pok\u00e9mon. Barboach remains in its aquatic environment to prevent itself from drying out and becoming weak. Barboach can use its whiskers to detect the location of its prey, and to detect both smell and flavor similar to a human.",

It has a cavernous mouth with light blue lips that have short, thin whiskers growing from the lower lips. Long, yellow barbels grow from its cheeks, and there is a yellow marking on its forehead that resembles a W. The light blue dorsal fin has a pattern of three spots arranged in a triangle, while its horizontal tail fin lacks spots. Its pectoral fins and belly fins match its main body color.\nWhiscash uses its caudal fin to cause earthquakes that can extend for over three miles by hitting the bottom of swamp beds. Whiscash can predict when natural earthquakes will occur. It also uses these massive earthquakes to drive away any foes that come near it, going on rampages in the process. This behavior, along with sightings of Whiscash's leaping from lakes, has caused people to mistaken it for starting earthquakes. It lives in a nest at the bottom of ponds and swamps, and is territorial over them. Whiscash tends to wait silently for prey to come to it. This gluttonous fish will eat anything that is alive, sometimes whole, and was shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Whiscash and Ash to eat inanimate objects as well. Whiscash also has a diet of consuming mud. Whiscash has poor eyesight, so it has to use its whiskers to detect a prey's vibration.",

            "description": "Crawdaunt is a primarily red, crustacean Pok\u00e9mon with a tan underside. It has circular eyes set in deep sockets and a large, star-shaped growth on its forehead. The upper and lower halves of its underside are separated by a pattern of angular red shapes, and there are two blue stripes on its throat. Its forelimbs have two large pincers with spiked edges and tan lower halves form. There are two sets of hind limbs. The foremost pair are simple claws with two spikes, while the rear pair are large and thick with two white claws. A yellow triangle marks the base of its lobster-like tail.\nCrawdaunt is a very violent Pok\u00e9mon that lives in ponds . Because of its constant challenges to battle, no other Pok\u00e9mon wants to inhabit its territory. Not even a swarm of Basculin will drive Crawdaunt away. Any that do venture too close are tossed out of its pond with its pincers. An experienced Crawdaunt will be covered in scars from countless battles. However, it must molt regularly and its shell is soft immediately after. Once its pincers fall off, Crawdaunt turns timid until they grow back. In order to protect itself, it burrows under stream beds until its new shell hardens. Unlike the meat found in the claws of Crabrawler and Clauncher , Crawdaunt's have foul smell and taste. Crawdaunt are known to be extremely difficult to raise.",

A red stripe encircles its body and forms a ring on its belly. It has flat appendages that resemble arms. A spike protrudes from the top of its head and another, smaller spike under its body acts as its foot. It moves by spinning on this single, pointed foot, and balances upright to sleep. Baltoy is usually found in ruins and old graveyards, where it assembles with its kind and unleashes loud cries. Old cave wall paintings depict it living with people in ancient times. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Me, Myself and Time , an ancient civilization used Baltoy for time travel when spinning on a magic circle artifact.",

Two smaller orbs sit at its sides like limbs and a peg-like protrusion extends from each orb that is capable of firing various energy beams. These two orbs are not attached to its body but are usually kept floating close by Claydol's psychic powers. Claydol uses the same telekinetic abilities to move and float through the air. It lives in rough terrains .\nClaydol has a body that is prone to melting when wet and uses its psychic powers to protect itself from rain.

However, its true eyes are concealed inside the dark, crescent opening on its head. Surrounding its head at the base are eight pink tentacles, which somewhat resemble flower petals. Its long, flexible neck has yellow bands in the center, and it can be extended to assist in capturing prey. Its body is short and squat with four stubby growths and a yellow, oval, target-like pattern on the chest.\nCradily's heavy body acts as an anchor, preventing it from getting washed away by rough ocean currents. In ancient times, it built its nest in the shallows of warm seas . When the tide went out, it came up on land to search for prey. However, Cradily cannot move very fast due to its short legs. Instead, Cradily can extend its neck and tentacles by three times its usual length. It then uses its tentacles to capture them and melts them with strong digestive acidic fluid secreted by the tentacles.",

These wing-like projections are used to propel Anorith through the water.\nNow extinct in the wild, it lived in the seas of ancient times 100,000,000 years ago. While still extinct, it has been seen under the ownership of Trainers as a result of being revived from Claw Fossils . Despite this, Anorith can no longer thrive in today's oceans because the water composition has changed since ancient times. Anorith can swim easily through the seas using its eight wings like oars from a boat. Anorith is considered the ancestor of modern bug Pok\u00e9mon.",

A black pattern with two red, teardrop-shaped spots covered the center of its head and a yellow lower jaw. Three pairs of wing-like appendages extend from the sides of its long, thick neck. A plate of armor on its back has four short spikes and two triangular, yellow-rimmed wings extending from underneath. Its scaled chest and belly are rimmed with yellow lines as well, and there are two large yellow plates in the center of its chest. Its segmented arms extend from holes in these plates, each with a large, black claw. The legs are also segmented, with black knees. A pair of black fins tips its long tail.\nIn ancient times, Armaldo lived on land by the water's edge, and dived into the ocean to hunt for prey. The large wings on its back were used for swimming, while its thick shell protected it from enemy attacks. Its strong claws can break stones, punch through a steel slab, and take down prey. Furthermore, they can be freely extended or retracted. It is considered to be the ancestor of some Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon.",

It is often found in oceans and weed-choked ponds , even if only a little water is available. While there are many of these Pok\u00e9mon in existence, populations tend to cluster in small areas. Once found, its dull wits make it easy to capture. Feebas is a source of research due to its vitality despite it being unattractive and unpopular.

            "description": "Milotic is an aquatic, serpentine Pok\u00e9mon with a primarily cream-colored body. It has red eyes with long, pinkish antennae above them. Additionally, there are long, hair-like fins above its eyes, which begin thin and thicken towards the tips. These eyebrows extend to almost half of Milotic's body length and will be longer on the female than the male. On top of its relatively small head is a straight spike. Running down either side of its neck are three black dots, similar to gills. Its lower body is a pattern of blue and pink, diamond-shaped scales outlined with black. The tail consists of four large, blue fins with pink ovals in their centers. Each of the tail fins overlaps the next slightly, causing it to resemble a fan. Milotic's scales are said to change color depending on the viewing angle, which has so far only been depicted in Pok\u00e9mon Battle Revolution .\nMilotic is said to be the most beautiful of all Pok\u00e9mon. In fact, it is said to have inspired many artists in their works. However, there are Trainers who prefer Feebas over it, seemingly disappointed after it evolves from said Pok\u00e9mon. When there are fights going on, it has the power to calm angry feelings and end arguments by releasing a wave of energy. In addition, it can move by floating in the air as shown in the twelfth Pok\u00e9mon movie . It lives at the bottom of large lakes .\nPrior to Generation V , Milotic was the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Marvel Scale as an Ability .\nA special Milotic is worshipped in Lental for being one of the seven guardian Illumina Pok\u00e9mon . It resides in the Belusylva Island Illumina Spot.",

In its Normal form, it resembles a plain, gray cloud with a single wisp extending from the top of its head.\nRegardless of the form it takes, it will always have a large, spherical head and a lighter-colored mask-like marking over its eyes. Various experiments were conducted to change its form in artificial conditions, but all have failed. In Generation III , Weather Ball was its signature move . Despite its man-made origins, it can be found in grassland areas .\nCastform is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Forecast as an Ability .",

On either side of its head are yellow frills, which are connected by lines to its yellow lips and rings around its eyes. There are small ridges on its shoulders and a red zigzag stripe around its midsection. The hands and feet have three short digits each, and it has yellow soles. It also has a long skinny tail that is usually curled tightly in a spiral.\nKecleon is able to change the colors of its body at will and is known for frequently using this ability to camouflage itself. However, it is unable to change the color of its red stripe. Its color also changes based on its mood and health, darkening in color with better health. By using camouflage to appear almost invisible, it can sneak up on prey and ensnare it with its long pink tongue. If unnoticed for too long, though, it pouts and may never reveal itself. This Pok\u00e9mon lives in tropical and temperate forests .\nAlthough Kecleon typically appears as green with yellow stripes, it is known to possess various non- Shiny color variations. A purplish variant of Kecleon appeared in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode The Kecleon Caper , as a TCG card , and in the Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon series ; the purplish Kecleon in the latter also has light-green outlines rather than yellow. Blue, red, and brown variants of Kecleon have made a singular appearance in the TCG . Whether these variants are an example of it changing color or if they are different kinds of Kecleon is unclear.\nKecleon is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Color Change as an Ability . In Generation VIII , this was also true for Protean .",

The emotions it feeds on include anger, jealousy, resentment, and malice, so some people are grateful for its presence. This also helps Shuppet become slowly stronger. A nocturnal Pok\u00e9mon, Shuppet will appear in swarms beneath the eaves of houses with negative people. As such, there exists a proverb that says, \u201cShun the house where Shuppet gather in the growing dusk\u201d. It is most commonly found in cities and other urban settings and will retreat to the nest in which it lives when the sun rises. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , a Shuppet sleeping near the sleeping person will eat up their dark feelings. As a result, the person will wake up in the morning with their mood improved.",

Its long, flat arms have three-fingered hands, while its legs are short and stubby. It has a yellow, brush-like tail.\nBeing driven to life by a powerful grudge, it keeps its life force safely in its body by the means of its zipped up mouth. If unzipped, it would lose its energy. It lays curses on others by using its body as a voodoo doll and sticking pins into itself. It lives in garbage dumps and dark alleys , where it searches for the person that threw it away before it became a Pok\u00e9mon. It is said that treating it with enough care will satisfy its grudge and will turn it back into a stuffed toy. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Banette apparently laughs happily while sleeping. It is believed a sleeping Banette is remembering a time where it was loved and cared for.",

It has a mask that resembles a skull and a single eye that floats between its eye sockets.\nDuskull can become invisible, sneaking up on their prey and going through walls. Duskull is primarily a nocturnal Pok\u00e9mon and has been shown to live in thick forests . Once Duskull chooses a target, it will doggedly pursue the intended victim until the break of dawn. It has been described as enjoying the crying of children, and it is said that this Pok\u00e9mon will spirit away disobedient children. This is often told to children to make them behave. Duskulls's diet consists of the vital energy of children. All victims of Duskull tend to suffer an intense chill after being drained of their life force.",

It has two wispy, light gray growths coming out of its shoulders and one on top of its head. Its light gray hands are almost always depicted as being directly attached to its body, though in PK15 and in several panels of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures they can be seen floating independently.\nIts body can absorb anything much like a black hole , pulling through the gaps between the bandages and wrapping it. It is unknown what happens when something is absorbed in Dusclops, as nothing ever comes back out. It will wave its hands and eyes to hypnotize opponents and then force them to do as it desires. Dusclops preys on drifting will-o'-the-wisps , sucking them into its body. It usually lives in thick forests and is generally active during nighttime.",

It has a long neck with a thin black line around it. It uses its neck for reaching treetops to gorge on its most favored fruit. Since it ate only this kind of fruit continuously, the fruit began to grow around its neck. These yellow, banana-like fruits can be picked and consumed by other Pok\u00e9mon or humans, and grow twice a year because of the rapid production of sugar in Tropius's leaves. Its feet have toenails the same color as its fruit.\nIn warm areas, there are ranches that raise Tropius. In Alola , its fruit is especially sweet compared to those of other regions. It lives in tropical jungles . In the TCG , Tropius was shown existing before the time Fossil Pok\u00e9mon went extinct.",

Its body has a horizontal amaranth -colored pattern. Underneath its body extends a long, tag-like tail that has amaranth patterning at the bottom. A yellow, globular growth, referred to as a suction cup or a sucker , is connected to the top of its body.\nChimecho can create ultrasonic sound waves and other noises. It uses seven different echoing cries to communicate with others. It is nocturnal and usually lives in grasslands and woods, but some are found in mountainous regions. An omnivorous species, it eats Berries that it plucks with its tail and can knock out large prey using powerful waves of air, which are thought to be created by Chimecho amplifying the faint sound of wind inside its body.",

It has a ruff around its neck and chest and a tuft on the top of its head adorned with a single blue-black oval. Between the dark fur, the curvature of the white fur on its head, and the positioning of its horn, Absol's face vaguely resembles a wu wei symbol. It has a humanoid face with almond-shaped, red eyes, a scythe-like tail, and a scythe-shaped horn on the side of its head. Its broad feet are equipped with three claws each, and dewclaw-like spikes protrude from the heels of its hind legs and the elbows of its front legs. It walks with a pacing gait like that of a bear.\nAbsol lives in the mountains far from civilization, and it rarely ventures down from its alpine home. Using its horn, Absol is able to sense even subtle changes in the sky and the land to predict when a disaster will occur and will try to warn people when one is approaching. Absol is also known to protect fields from natural disasters as well. This often has the unfortunate effect of Absol itself being blamed for the disaster, notably by the elderly. The hatred for Absol was started years ago by superstitions surrounding about it. Despite this, others are interested in its ability to predict disaster. Absol has been referred to as a bringer of doom . Absol can move as swiftly as the wind. Absol is said to have a lifespan of up to 100 years. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , the powers of Absol's horn remains active even when it sleeps. Due to this, Absol can strongly detect danger even when its not awake.",

The fur on its body ends in a zigzag pattern, extending over its short legs. Wynaut's tail is long and completely black, ending in a round, flattened tip with a white, eye-like spot.\nWynaut tends to live in caves and travel in herds. It will test its endurance by squeezing up against other Wynaut at night. In doing so, it strengthens itself, toughens its spirit, and learns to launch powerful counterattacks. When angered, it will slap the ground with its tail. As it loves to eat sweet fruit, it is also drawn to fruit gardens. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Wynaut maintains its smile even while sleeping. Slapping the ground with its black tail is a possible sign that Wynaut is feeling restless and angry in it sleep.\nPrior to Generation V , Wynaut and its evolved form, Wobbuffet , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Shadow Tag as an Ability .",

It is covered with a yellow cloak that gives it a triangular outline. The coat is rimmed with an orange stripe and has three orange diamond markings on the back. As its evolved form Glalie has a body of rock, Snorunt may also be made of rock. In Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet , defeating a Snorunt, Glalie, or Froslass will yield some \" Snorunt fur \", suggesting the cloak is made of fur.\nWell-adapted to life in colder climates, it subsists on snow and ice and can survive temperatures as low as \u2212150 degrees Fahrenheit . Snorunt is also a social creature, living and traveling with other Snorunt in groups of five. The group can live together in harmony while residing underneath giant leaves. It can be found in caves , particularly when the outside lacks snow or areas with heavy snowfall. Despite this, the Snorunt population in Alola shows it can survive in some places with warm weather. Additionally, it has been known to visit human dwellings. There is a legend that any home a Snorunt visits and lives near will prosper for generations. There is a tradition where houses would leave a lump of ice made from pure water for Snorunt to have when visiting. Playing with Snorunt is a favorite childhood memory for rich people who live in cold areas. It is believed that if Snorunt shows up during the night, they will cause heavy snow to appear in the morning.",

            "description": "Glalie is a spherical Pok\u00e9mon that consists of a black rock core covered by ice. The icy covering has several holes and spaces across this Pok\u00e9mon's body. Blue eyes and a mouth with flat teeth are visible through three of these holes. There are two large, black, conical horns on either side of Glalie's head.\nThere is a legend that says Glalie was born from a boulder that has absorbed the distress and regrets from any mountaineers that got lost on icy mountains. Glalie's icy body is actually rock that is not particularly hard. When covered in ice, its body becomes harder than steel. It does not melt, and it can control ice by instantly freezing moisture in the air into any desirable shape. This ability is used to drape itself in ice armor and freeze its prey, which it then consumes whole. It prefers consuming Pok\u00e9mon that are already frozen, such as Vanillite . It can be found in caves , particularly when the outside weather lacks snow.\nIn the animated series , Glalie is depicted floating in midair and moving freely, similar to flying, and can even be ridden as a form of transport .",

This covering of fluffy fur, combined with the layer of blubber underneath, retains heat and protects Spheal from the cold. It has black, circular eyes; small tusks protruding from its upper jaw; and small, rounded ears. Its stubby flippers and its underside are both beige.\nWhen it is happy or cheerful, such as when eating in a group, this Pok\u00e9mon will clap its fins. The mealtimes of Spheal have been described as noisy as a result. Because its body is poorly shaped for swimming and can only walk slowly, it moves primarily by rolling across ice floes. This Pok\u00e9mon lives in and around the sea . Spheal also lives on any drift ice that comes near the shore in order to avoid predators. Spheal are often juggled by its evolved form Sealeo , which does so to check the former's health. When a Spheal finds prey while drifting at sea, it will inform the Walrein leader of its herd on where to find the prey. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Spheal has been seen clapping its fins merrily while asleep on its back. It has led to those being curious about what happy things Spheal is dreaming about once it awakens.\nPrior to Generation VI , Ice Ball was its signature move , but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .",

It has a round snout and yellow eyes, and large tufts of white fur about its face and neck. Its four short legs have long flippers instead of feet.\nWalrein lives in and around icy seas , where it is insulated against the cold by its thick layer of blubber. This layer of fat also protects it from enemy attacks by causing them to bounce off. While its long tusks are capable of crushing ice up to 10 tons in one blow, they may break during battle. Walrein's tusks grow continuously throughout its life, and any broken ones will grow back by the following year. The Hisui region is famous for the many broken tusks of Walrein that can be found there. This Pok\u00e9mon can be found in herds of 20 to 30 individuals, which are fiercely protected by the leader. The leader is willing to give up its life in order to protect the herd. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Walrein has been seen sleeping with a tusk stuck in the ground. It is believed that the Pok\u00e9mon fell asleep while tending to it tusks.\nPrior to Generation VI , Ice Ball was its signature move , but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .",

The shell is used to clamp down on prey, as well as for protection. A fully-grown shell will have nicks and scratches all over. Inside of the shell is a fragile, light blue body composed of six spherical extensions with a pink, pearl-like head in the center, usually depicted with its eyes closed. There is a circular white patch on each cheek.\nThe pearls produced by this Pok\u00e9mon amplify psychic power and can be blue in color, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Clamperl of Wisdom . Spoink 's pearls come from Clamperl. These pearls are also 10 times more valuable than pearls produced by Shellder . It is carnivorous, clamping down on prey without letting go until it stops moving. When it is close to evolution, Clamperl will become too big to fit inside its shell. Clamperl is the only Pok\u00e9mon that gains extra effects by holding a Deep Sea Tooth or Deep Sea Scale . Clamperl have been observed being carried by Drifblim , its natural predator.",

Huntail's large mouth features sharp teeth and allows it to gulp its prey whole.\nHuntail swims by wiggling its body, though it is not the strongest swimmer. Its sturdy spine and large eyes allows it to survive in the high pressures and darkness of the deep sea .

Additionally, it has dorsal and pelvic fins near its tail. Its tail fin has a wavy outline.\nThe composition of its scales, along with its fatty body and oil-filled swim bladders , allow it to withstand the intense pressure of the ocean depths . Relicanth once had teeth, but they have long since atrophied; as such, Relicanth is a filter feeder , feeding on microscopic organisms that it sucks up with its toothless mouth. It has remained unchanged for 100 million years and stays as such because it is already a perfect life-form. It was discovered during a deep-sea expedition.

            "description": "Luvdisc is a fishlike Pok\u00e9mon with a relatively flat body in the shape of a heart. It is primarily light pink, with pale lips and circular markings on its cheeks. Its body is covered in heart-shaped scales.\nLuvdisc lives in shallow tropical warm seas , where it makes its nest in the branches of Corsola or coral reefs. During its breeding season, it forms groups that turn the ocean's surface bright pink. As shown in Luvdisc is a Many Splendored Thing! , when two Luvdisc kiss, they are able to use their slender bodies as wings in order to fly for short periods of time. If a Luvdisc is left alone, it becomes disheartened and open to attacks from predators, such as Pelipper .\nLuvdisc is seen as symbol of love and romance; loving couples gave this Pok\u00e9mon its name after spotting it in the ocean waters. It is said that any couple who sees a Luvdisc will be blessed with eternal love, thus honeymoon hotels usually release this Pok\u00e9mon into their pools. A tradition in some places is to gift a Luvdisc to a person someone loves. At one point in the past, Luvdisc was overfished due to a rumor that its scales would allow one to find their sweetheart.",

            "description": "Bagon is a bipedal, blue, reptilian Pok\u00e9mon vaguely resembling a Pachycephalosaurus . It possesses a large, round snout, triangular eyes, yellow, circular ears similar to reptiles, and a yellow lower jaw with two teeth protruding upwards. Three thick, gray ridges cover the top of its head and continue downwards to cover its neck as well. There is a triangular patch of yellow on its underside. It has stubby, digit-less arms and short legs with two toes on each foot.\nBagon lives in rough terrains with cliffs and rocks. It longs to fly and jumps off cliffs trying to be able to do so. Frustrated at its inability to fly, it leaps off cliffs and smashes its head against large rocks indiscriminately. This process of continually bashing its head causes it to become as hard as steel. Well-developed neck muscles support its hard head. This, combined with its powerful body, allows it to shatter rocks with its head. Bagon is known to be rather solitary, preferring not to form groups with others of its kind. It has been theorized that Bagon's habit of head-bashing and pure belief influences the cells needed to help it evolve.",

This bony covering repels enemy attacks, but it makes Shelgon heavy. Its gray legs are visible protruding from underneath the shell, each with a short red stripe on the inner surface.\nAs a result, this Pok\u00e9mon moves sluggishly and supposedly never eats or drinks, but it never seems to starve or thirst to death for reasons unknown. Inside the shell, its body is busy forming for its next evolution. It stores the necessary energy needed to evolve, and when it does, its shell begins to peel away. Shelgon can be found in caverns , where it stays still until it evolves.",

There are red markings on its throat, the underside of its tail, and stripes on the inner surface of its legs. Additionally, there are raised red ridges above its eyes. Three flat fins protrude from either side of its head, possibly acting in the same manner that a Canard would on an aircraft. It has two pairs of pointed teeth, one in the upper jaw and one in the lower. Each of its short legs has three claws. Salamence is considered an unusual Pok\u00e9mon due to the circumstances of its evolution; its fervent desire to fly triggered a cellular mutation that allowed it to suddenly grow large, red wings.\nIts long-held dream fulfilled at last, Salamence constantly flies around and releases intense blasts of fire as an expression of its joy. It only stops flying when it gets exhausted and needs to sleep. If enraged, it loses all sense of self and flies into an uncontrollable rampage, destroying everything around it until it tires itself out. It lives in rough terrain , and it competes with Garchomp midair for food.",

A short crest projects from its body and extends over its head.\nEven though Beldum is mechanical, it still has emotions, the need to eat, and a way of reproducing. Beldum's body lacks blood, and is instead made of cells that are all magnets. It uses magnetism to move, communicate, and control its attacks. Beldum sometimes gathers in swarms, communicating with each other telepathically and magnetically and moving in sync. When enraged, it can cause nearby machines to break from its strong magnetism. Beldum can also use its magnetic force to rapidly pull in enemies and then use its sharp claws to harm them. Beldum is scarce in the wild, but it does tend to inhabit areas with rugged terrain . It anchors itself to a cliff using its hooks when it sleeps.",

A jet cannot scratch Metang due to its strong body. There is a gray spike in the middle of its face, similar to a nose. A pair of red eyes reside in two holes in its metallic skin. While it appears to lack legs, it has a pair of thick arms with three claws on the ends. The arms are considerably thicker below the elbow and have a flat, blunt protrusion extending over the joint.\nMetang is formed when two Beldum fuse together. A magnetic nervous system joins the brains of these two Pok\u00e9mon. This linkage allows Metang to generate a strong, psychokinetic power that is doubled. However, this does not increase its intellect. This Pok\u00e9mon's high intelligence and strong magnetic field are other sources of powerful psychic energy. In addition to generating psychic power, its magnetism allows Metang to hover in midair. It is able to rotate its arms backwards in order to travel at speeds over 60 mph (100 km/h) in search of prey. When Metang finds its prey, it uses its psychic power to stop it from escaping. Then it firmly grabs onto the prey with its claws, never letting go. Metang's claws are able to rip through steel. This Pok\u00e9mon lives on rough terrains and harsh mountains. It pursues Nosepass , loving its magnetic minerals.",

The main body appears to serve as both head and body, and this Pok\u00e9mon's overall construction gives it the appearance of a mechanized arachnid. It uses its heavy body to pin down its prey before consuming them with its large mouth. A large, metallic cross is situated in the center of its face. On either side of the cross, a red eye peers out from a space in Metagross's metallic armor. Its four legs are joined to the main body by ball-and-socket joints. While the upper portion of the legs is relatively thin, they are considerably thicker below the knee. Each leg has three short claws on the end and a flat, blunt protrusion extending over the knee. The legs can be tucked in, allowing Metagross to float in the air.\nMetagross is the result of two Metang fusing together. This gives Metagross four brains in total, all connected by a complex network of neurons. Because of these complex connections and the number of brains, this Pok\u00e9mon is capable of performing complex calculations and is more intelligent than a supercomputer . It is imbued with psychic powers and uses its intelligence to analyze its opponents during battle. Metagross uses its fantastic strength to pin down a victim using its four claws and body. This allows Metagross to use its large mouth and teeth to chew its victim to pieces. This Pok\u00e9mon can be found on rough terrains . Metagross can also be found living in snowy mountains as their magnetic powers become stronger in freezing temperatures.",

It has long arms with jutting shoulders and club-like hands without fingers. There is a line of orange rocky spines running down its back, and its legs are short in comparison to its body. When it gets damaged in battle, it will search for new rocks to repair itself. Because of this, the rocks it is made of come from several different places around the world, which contributes to Regirock's patchwork appearance. Recently, cutting-edge technology has found that Regirock is entirely made of stone and rock, as it does not seem to have a heart or brain. According to legend, Regirock was created by Regigigas . It generally lives in caves or ruins, where it was sealed away years ago by ancient people.",

Most of Registeel's body is spherical and gray while the middle of its face has the appearance of being exposed as it shows black \"skin\" and is surrounded by raised metal. Registeel's lower half is disc-like in shape and has two cylindrical legs without toes. Its face consists of seven red dots in a hexagonal formation, and it has black arms with three fingers each that are connected to its upper half by gray hemispherical shoulders. The backs of its hands have three red triangles pointing away from the fingers.\nWhile Registeel has been classified as a Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon , its body is hollow and made of a material that is harder than any known metal. However, this material stretches and shrinks despite its hardness. While one Pok\u00e9dex entry noted that the material that forms Registeel's body is extraterrestrial, it is also theorized that Registeel was actually born inside the Pok\u00e9mon world 's mantle, before emerging onto the surface 10,000 years ago. Further evidence supporting this theory is the fact that Registeel's body was tempered by pressure underground over thousands of years; as a result, it cannot be scratched. Another theory posits that Registeel was created by Regigigas out of magma. It is unknown what Registeel can eat. It was sealed away in ruins by people during ancient times.",

A blue triangle marks the center of its chest, while a red mask partially covers its face. Ear-like fins sit on top of its head and its eyes are yellow. It has short, three-fingered arms with a red covering on the outer side of the lower arms. Latias is a female-only species, with Latios being its male counterpart.\nLatias ruffles its feathers and cries loudly when there is hostility toward it. Its glass-like, downy feathers can enfold its body and refract light, which allows it to become invisible or alter its appearance. It is highly intelligent and can understand human speech. It is capable of using telepathy to communicate with others. In the fifth movie , Latias had the ability \"Sight Sharing\", which allowed Latias and people around it to see exactly what Latios was seeing. It normally does not make contact with humans or other Pok\u00e9mon and disappears when an enemy is nearby. It forms herds with several members and is usually found near water . Latias loves Latias Treats made by Snacksworth , who once encountered it in the past.

Jet-plane wings sit on top of its back, while two tall, jagged fins point behind it from its rear. A red triangle marks the center of its chest, while a blue mask partially covers its face. Long, ear-like fins extend from its jaws to over its head, and its eyes are red. It has three-fingered arms with a blue covering on the outer side of the lower arms. Latios is a male-only species, with Latias being its female counterpart.\nLatios has a gentle nature and will avoid fighting whenever possible. It can fly faster than a jet by tucking in its arms. In the fifth movie , Latios had the ability \"Sight Sharing\" (Japanese: \u3086\u3081\u3046\u3064\u3057 Dream Analysis ) which allowed Latias and people around it to see exactly what Latios was seeing. Oakley also mentioned that it can shape-shift. It prefers compassionate Trainers, to whom it opens its heart. Latios uses telepathy to detect locations and the emotions of others and can understand human speech. It lives by the water's edge . Latios loves Latios Treats made by Snacksworth , who once encountered and followed it to a secret spot in the past. Latios can be summoned by the Eon Flute .\nLatios is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Luster Purge .",

It has red-tipped, rudder-like wings on its shoulders and down its body, and similarly patterned fins on the tip of its tail. Yellow ring-like symbols run across the length of Rayquaza's body and it has an additional yellow ring on top of its head. Rayquaza has two limbs with three-clawed hands, and two long, flat, horn-like structures on its head, with two shorter horns along its jawline. It has small, yellow eyes with black pupils, prominent pink gums, and two discernible fangs in its upper jaw.\nRayquaza has a strong and endless desire to do heroic deeds for the Pok\u00e9mon world . Rayquaza can halt the endless battles of the other two super-ancient Pok\u00e9mon , by forcing both back into their slumber, even in their Primal Forms . Rayquaza is the only one who can stop the duo and restore order to nature. Rayquaza is said to have lived for hundreds of millions of years in the ozone layer , where it feeds on water and other particles. It also feeds on meteoroids , particularly Mega Stones and even on the Minior in the stratosphere of the Alola region . It also loves Rayquaza Treats made by Snacksworth , who once encountered it in the past. Rayquaza is rarely seen by people; even in flight, its appearance is indistinguishable from that of a meteor. For living in the ozone layer, it can breathe in outer space.\nRayquaza possesses some of the strongest attack power out of any Pok\u00e9mon; it can easily summon cyclones to overwhelm its opponents. It can soar into the sky and droop out into its foes at high speeds , causing huge damage. Thanks to its weather-manipulation powers, it can eliminate weather effects . Rayquaza was worshiped by the Draconid people along with the people of Hoenn as the savior of the region. Thus, they built the Sky Pillar to honor it. Additionally, it can be summoned atop Sky Pillar by a Key Stone . In Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , the Draconids referred to it as their \" Dragon Lord \". It is one of the longest-lived Pok\u00e9mon species. Inside Rayquaza's body lies an organ that contains the same power as a Mega Stone . A Devon Corporation scientist named this organ the \"mikado organ\". By consuming meteoroids as it flies through the stratosphere, the organ will be filled with enough energy to enable Rayquaza's Mega Evolution .\nRayquaza is bitter enemies with Deoxys , with the two often clashing with each other due to Rayquaza's territorial nature. This depicted in the movie Destiny Deoxys and the games Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire and Masters EX .\nRayquaza is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Dragon Ascent . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Air Lock as an Ability .",

            "description": "Jirachi is a small, white, humanoid Pok\u00e9mon . It has short, stubby legs and comparatively longer arms. There are flaps on the underside of its arms, which give the impression of long sleeves. On its belly is a curved seam, which conceals a third, yellow eye with a cyan pupil, known as its \"true eye\". Additionally, Jirachi has a normal pair of ovalish eyes on its face, with small, blue triangular markings underneath. On its head is a large, yellow structure with three points extending outward: one from the top and one on either side. On each point is a teal tag, known as a \"wish tag\". A rounded extension hangs from either side of the yellow structure, framing Jirachi's face. Two yellow streamers flow from Jirachi's back, resembling comet tails.\nJirachi hibernates for most of its life, awakening for seven days every thousand years. It can be also awakened if sung to by a voice of purity. While it sleeps, a tough, crystalline shell envelops its body to protect it from enemies. However, it is still capable of fighting while asleep when its shell is not enough to protect it, as seen in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon . During the short periods when it is awake, Jirachi is said to grant wishes. However, in the movie Jirachi: Wish Maker , Jirachi cannot create an object that is desired from a wish. Instead, it teleports the desired object to the person that made the wish. By contrast, in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Black & White episode Searching for a Wish! , it displays the ability to grant wishes without the use of teleportation. In the Pok\u00e9mon Adventures manga, Jirachi will only grant wishes when its true eye is opened. Additionally, it can only grant three wishes every thousand years, which are written on each of its three wish tags. In this canon , Jirachi is shown being able to create artificial Pok\u00e9mon through its wishes, animating a mass of seawater in the shape of a Kyogre . Jirachi's power is similarly exploited in the movie to create a monstrous Groudon . The movie further reveals that Jirachi's awakening is linked to the appearance of the Millennium Comet and that its third eye has the ability to absorb the energy Jirachi needs for hibernation. It is said that Jirachi's ability to grant wishes also gives it great attack power, as seen when it creates a concentrated bundle of light to blast its target. Although it is extremely rare, Jirachi can be found in the mountains .\nJirachi is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Doom Desire .",

The main components that are constant for all four forms are dominantly a red color, a light blue face, and three light blue dots on its back arranged in a triangle. Typically, there is a purple stripe running down the center of its face and a purple, crystalline organ in its chest. Its white, circular eyes are set inside rectangular, black eye sockets. As shown in Destiny Deoxys, some Deoxys can have a green crystalline organ and facial stripe. In its Normal Forme, Deoxys has tapering legs with a segmented, vertical, blue stripe on the upper portion. The abdomen is black with vertical lines, while the majority of its skin is reddish-orange. The arms are capable of taking different forms, usually a pair of tentacles coiled in a double helix. One tentacle is the primary skin color, while the other is light blue. Alternately, it can form more humanoid arms with a red top and blue underside and a five-fingered hand. This Forme has a blunt protrusion with a single blue stripe on either side of its head and stubby tail.",

Its body is covered by a brown shell that is composed of earth. The shell has a thick black stripe and a black rim. On a very healthy Turtwig, the shell should feel moist. A small seedling grows on a brown patch on its head. This seedling will wilt if the Pok\u00e9mon becomes thirsty.\nSince it is a plant-based Pok\u00e9mon, Turtwig usually nourishes itself through photosynthesis; it becomes more energetic when exposed to enough sunlight. It also drinks water, which hardens its soil-based shell. Due to its status as a first partner Pok\u00e9mon, a wild Turtwig is hard to come by and it is generally found under the ownership of Trainers . It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy .",

Grotle's lower jaw is yellow and has triangular extensions on the cheeks, while its upper jaw has a hooked tip. Its feet are yellow and have three claws each.\nGrotle can sense where pure water wells are and will carry other Pok\u00e9mon on its back to these sources.

            "description": "Torterra is a tall, bulky, quadrupedal Pok\u00e9mon resembling a tortoise , with a large shell covering its back. There is a single, oak-like tree and three triangular, stony extensions resembling mountain peaks on the top of the shell. There is a patch of brown, resembling soil, next to the tree. A white rim surrounds the shell and forms a diamond-shaped continuation on the front. Torterra's body appears sectioned, with the upper half being green and the lower half brown. Its mouth is jagged, which gives it the appearance of a snapping turtle. It also has a black nose. Its lower jaw is green and there are two large spikes protruding from its cheeks. Torterra's small, red eyes are encircled by a black ring. Its legs are thick and they have four toes each, which appear as if they are actually jagged stones. There are three toes on the front and one on the heel.\nTorterra's large and clean shell supports the lives of many small Pok\u00e9mon, which occasionally gather and build their nests upon the shell . Some are even born and spend their entire lives there. Torterra migrates in groups, searching for clean water, creating the illusion of moving forests. However, it is typically immobile. Torterra is believed to possess unmatched physical strength. Ancient people believed the ground contained a gigantic Torterra living underneath.",

Its fur is primarily a shade of orange, although its face, outer ears, underbelly, hands, and feet are light yellow. Its ears are large in comparison to its head, and has red insides. It also has red markings around its eyes, as well as two pointed teeth in its upper jaw, a swirl-like symbol on its chest, and five fingers on its hands with three toes on its feet. It has a swirly crest of hair on its head. Its rear has a small, round, red patch that is usually obscured by flames produced by burning gas in its stomach. These flames cannot be put out by rain, although they go out when Chimchar goes to sleep, and burn weakly when it feels ill. In the past, this flame on its rear has caused people to mistake it for an apparition, dubbed the \"Lantern-Tail\". Chimchar is very agile, being able to climb the rocky ledges of tall mountains where it lives. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy .",

A small tuft of fur extends from the top of Monferno's head, and it has oval, brown eyes. Its eyes have a thick blue marking above and a small, red marking in-between. Its muzzle is short and blunt, with two small, pointed teeth in its upper jaw. There is a white ruff of fur around its neck and gold bands around its arms near its shoulders. It has five fingers on each hand, but only three toes on each foot. Its long tail has a red ring around the base and a flame burning at the tip.\nThe flame on Monferno's tail has several purposes. Primarily, it can be controlled to keep opponents at an ideal distance or stretched in order to make Monferno appear larger. The size of its flame, in combination with the brightness of its facial marking, indicates this Pok\u00e9mon's position in its pack. The bigger the flame and the brighter the pattern, the higher the Pok\u00e9mon's position. In addition to using its flaming tail as a weapon, Monferno can also leap from ceilings or walls to perform aerial attacks.",

There are five blue digits on both its feet and hands, and it has a long tail.\nThis agile Pok\u00e9mon practices a unique kind of martial art that involves all of its limbs, as it shrouds itself in flame and uses fiery punches and kicks. This form of battle is comparable to dancing. Infernape is also known to possess unrivalled speed and agility. Infernape's flame is also said to never go out.",

It has a dark blue head with a primarily white face and a short, yellow beak. The dark blue feathers on its head extend down its back and around its neck, which causes it to appear to be wearing a cape. There are two white ovals on its chest and a small, light-blue marking resembles a crown above its beak. It has flipper-like arms and yellow feet with three toes each.\nPiplup has a strong sense of self-pride. Because of its pride, it has a hard time accepting food from humans and bonding with its caretakers. It will even puff out its chest after it falls down, which it often does due to its poor walking abilities. However, it is a skilled swimmer that can dive for over ten minutes in order to hunt. It has also been shown to fly short distances in the animated series . It lives along the seashore in colder climates. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy .",

On its body are four large, white spots that resemble buttons. Instead of arms, it has long, sturdy, flipper-like wings that are capable of knocking over and snapping trees. It has short legs with yellow, three-toed feet.\nPrinplup has a high sense of self-pride, which prevents it from forming groups of its own kind.

There is a blue marking resembling a crown over its eyes and a white, lacy marking running down its chest. A blue, fin-like projection forms a collar around its throat and runs down the length of its chest and belly. On its back are two raised, gold bumps and a second blue fin that forms its tail. Its yellow feet are webbed with three toes each and its feathers form ruffs above its feet. It has wide, flipper-like wings rimmed with blue along the tips, and three golden claws.\nThe edges of these wings are comparable to master-crafted blades, capable of slicing through ice floes, and this Pok\u00e9mon will use them to attack anyone or anything that damages its pride. However, it prefers to avoid unnecessary disputes at times. When swimming in the water, Empoleon can move as fast as a jet boat. In Hisui , people have revered Empoleon since ancient times, referring to it as the Master of the Waves.",

            "description": "Starly is an avian Pok\u00e9mon with primarily grayish-brown plumage. There is a white marking on its face resembling a mask, and a white spot on its chest. The top portion of the mask marking is smaller on the female. The rest of its head and the lower half of its wings are black. Starly has a long, orange beak with a black tip, and oval, black eyes with white pupils. A small tuft of feathers curls over the back and its head, and a small, pointed ruff surrounds its neck. It has two black tail feathers with a white feather between them. Its feet are orange with three toes in the front and one in the back.\nStarly's small wings are powerful enough to leave foes with an injury that can last for a week. However, although capable of flapping its wings powerfully, Starly is weak and inconspicuous when alone. Starly congregates in mountains and fields, forming large flocks to protect itself. However, individuals will begin to bicker if the group becomes too large. This Pok\u00e9mon's cry is harsh, and its singing can become annoying. It preys on small Bug Pok\u00e9mon and Cherubi 's nutrient-rich second head. As depicted in The Lonely Snover! , it has also been seen consuming the acorn-like Berries grown on the bushes of Grotle .",

On its face is a white, mask-like marking with a pattern of spikes along the lower edge. It has small, black eyes with white pupils and a long, orange beak with a black tip. On the back of its head is a long tuft of feathers, which curves forward. The lower halves of its wings are black, and it has black tail feathers with a single white feather in the center. Its orange, anisodactyl feet have black talons.\nStaravia lives near forests and fields, where it hunts for Bug Pok\u00e9mon. Aware of its own weakness, it forms flocks of its own kind and cries noisily if left on its own. However, these flocks can be extremely territorial. When two different groups meet, they will have fierce territorial disputes. A strong Staravia can be identified by the plume it has on its head.",

Its powerful wing and leg muscles allow it to fly effortlessly while carrying other Pok\u00e9mon, small or large.\nUpon evolution, this Pok\u00e9mon leaves its flock to live alone, as it has become strong enough to take care of itself.

Cream-colored markings cover its underside and surround its face. Round tufts of fur form its tail, with five on the male and three on the female. Similar tufts line the bottom of its face and two singular ones form its ears. Bidoof's black paws have three toes with some webbing between them. Protruding from Bidoof's upper jaw are large incisors, which it uses for gnawing on wood and rocks. These teeth grow constantly, so this Pok\u00e9mon needs to gnaw on hard substances to keep them ground down. The growth rate of Bidoof's teeth is similar to Rattata .\nThis Pok\u00e9mon can be found nesting in groups near bodies of water, usually building a nest of dams to live in. It is also known to wander into villages, gnawing on people's houses. Despite its stout body and naive appearance, this Pok\u00e9mon can be agile and is not easily perturbed.\nPrior to Generation V , Bidoof and its evolved form, Bibarel , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Unaware as an Ability .",

Its face is covered by a tan mask with a rounded extension over each eye; the male will have an additional extension to the side of each eye. While its forepaws are small and slightly webbed, its hind paws are larger and more rounded. Both sets of paws are black with three toes, but the hind paws have circular, tan paw pads. Bibarel's large, flat tail is black with a tan, wavy marking near the tip. Rounded tufts of fur line each side of its face. Its short, dark brown snout has a small red nose and protruding upper incisors. These teeth are used for chewing trees.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon is known to be an industrious worker. It builds its nest by damming rivers, using bark, roots, and branches it has cut up with its teeth, along with mud. A river dammed by Bibarel will never overflow. Bibarel is slow-moving and awkward out of the water, but is a swift swimmer, comparable to a Feebas . Bibarel's fur is very good at repelling water and retaining heat.\nPrior to Generation V , Bibarel and its pre-evolved form, Bidoof , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Unaware as an Ability .",

By rubbing its arms together, Kricketune can produce sounds and improvise melodies. It can also allow its cry to resonate in its belly. Kricketune's melodies vary greatly between individuals, and can be used to signal its emotions. Scientists have been observing the melodic patterns of Kricketune for studies.

            "description": "Shinx is a quadrupedal, feline Pok\u00e9mon resembling a lion cub or lynx kitten. Its front half is light blue, while the rear is black. There is a short tuft of fur on its head and smaller tufts on each cheek. The top tuft is smaller on the female Shinx. It has large, oval ears with yellow, star-shaped markings on the insides; yellow eyes; and a tiny, red nose. Whenever its mouth is open, small fangs can be seen in its upper jaw. A black marking encircles Shinx's neck like a collar, and there are yellow bands above its forepaws. The hind paws are black on the male Shinx and blue on the female. Spiked fur surrounds the base of its long tail, which is tipped with a yellow star shape.\nElectricity is produced by the extension and contraction of muscles in Shinx's forelegs, which causes this Pok\u00e9mon's fur to glow. If it senses danger, its fur can gleam brightly to blind predators so it can flee. Excited trembling is a sign that Shinx is generating tremendous amounts of electricity. It can send signals to other Shinx by shining the tip of its tail and shaking it. It has an aggressive nature; thus, taming a Shinx is said to take great patience.",

The mane is longer on the male Luxio, while the blue coloration on the hind paws extends to the ankles on the female. The insides of its rounded ears are yellow, as are its eyes. There are two yellow rings around each front leg and a yellow, four-point star on the tip of its tail.\nWhen facing an opponent, Luxio extends its claws in preparation, which can unleash 1,000,000 volts of electricity. Even a slight scratch from these claws is enough to cause fainting. Besides for attacking, Luxio also uses its claws to communicate with others of its kind, by resting them on the others' forelegs and sending electrical pulses through them. Luxio live in small groups and are able to generate powerful electricity by gathering the group's tails together. Luxio are known to be kind enough to share the spoils from a hunt to its own kind.",

There are three yellow half-rings on the back of each foreleg. Its long, thin tail is tipped with a yellow four-pointed star.\nLuxray has powerful eyesight that is capable of seeing through most objects, like X-ray vision. It uses this ability for hunting and keeping track of its offspring. However, this ability requires a lot of electricity to use. As a result, Luxray needs to sleep for long periods of time in order to store up more energy. Luxray live in packs, each having one male to lead them.",

One vine has a blue spot, while the other has a red spot.\nBudew keeps its buds closed during the cold winter, but opens them again in the spring and releases poisonous pollen. The pollen it scatters induces harsh sneezing and runny noses, and is more toxic depending on how clean the water it was fed with was. Budew's bud beginning to open is seen as the imminent arrival of spring. It lives near clean pools and ponds.",

The cape pattern reaches toward the back of its head, in spiky, sepal-like extensions on the hair. A male will have a shorter cape than a female. It has a dark-green mask over its red, yellow-lidded eyes. The lower portion of its face is light green, and it holds a bouquet in each hand, with a red in its right hand and blue in its left. Its limbs and underside are light green. Its feet end with yellow tips.\nRoserade lures prey with a sweet aroma. The more toxic its poison, the sweeter its aroma becomes. Each hand has different toxins, but both hands can jab with near-deadly power. Roserade's right arm contains poisons that act faster, while its left arm contains poisons that act slower. Regardless, Roserade's poison can be life-threatening. It attacks with a dancer-like elegance and uses hidden whips covered with poisonous thorns.",

It has feet with three forward claws and one backward.\nIts main attacking prowess involves charging head-first into its opponents. When it lived in dense forests and jungles 100 million years ago, it would use headbutts to snap obstructing trees, down its prey, and combat Pok\u00e9mon like Aerodactyl and even other Cranidos. The resulting sound of two Cranidos headbutting echoes throughout the area like the sound of the pealing of a bell. It notably lacks any intelligence. Cranidos are considered to be a rare sight to encounter. The fossilized trunks of trees snapped in two are also often found near the fossilized rock layers of Cranidos fossils. It was brought back to life from a Skull Fossil . In modern times, Cranidos can be found at the Canyon Biome located at the Terarium .",

It has blue stripes, one on its tail, and one on each of its knees and wrists. It has various spikes: one on each knee, two on the blue-collar on its neck, two short ones on its nose, and four on its head. Two of these head spikes are bigger than the other two.\nIts strength lies within its fierce head-butting attacks. A charging Rampardos can knock down virtually anything with one hit. 100 million years ago, it lived in jungles, where it ruthlessly chased its prey while tearing down trees in its path. Rampardos has the personality of a brute. It enjoys barging into objects with its head to train its strength and reflexes. This resulted in its skull growing a foot thick and harder than steel, which prevents it from fainting if it crashes into anything, even another charging Rampardos. Long after its passing, ancient people would dig up its well-developed skull fossil and use it as a helmet. However, because its skull grew so thick, its brain became even smaller than that of Cranidos , leading to theories that its stupidity led to its extinction. Its fossils have been found near those of Bastiodon , suggesting that these two lived in the same habitat, likely as enemies. Very little was known about Rampardos's biology in ancient times. There were records of a Rampardos that escaped after being revived and evolved, destroying a skyscraper in the process.",

            "description": "Bastiodon is a Pok\u00e9mon which appears to be a cross between a ceratopsian such as Chasmosaurus and a bulldozer . Its dark gray, square head resembles a castle wall, complete with four cream-yellow, window-like spots with a black outline, three dark gray spikes on the top, and two larger gray spikes in the upper corners. Bastiodon's triangular nose extends from the middle of its shield-like head down over its lips and appears to be pierced by a gray, horizontal spike. Four spikes jut downward and four large, blunt tusks protrude upward from its dark gray lower jaw. Bastiodon's cream-yellow eyes are partially obscured by the nasal spike and spaced-out tusks. Its thick, cream-yellow body is further protected by a gray ridge and dark gray plates on its back, jagged growths on its legs, and a plated tail.\nIt is from roughly 100 million years ago. Bastiodon are known to live in herds. Despite its rough, intimidating appearance, Bastiodon is a docile, caring Pok\u00e9mon that feeds on grass and Berries . Its shield-like face is as tough as a diamond and capable of repelling any attack. When multiple Bastiodon line up side by side, their faces form a wall that nothing can break through; this was how they protected their young. In stark contrast to its impenetrable frontal defense, it is helpless when attacked from behind. Because its facial bones are so hard, they were initially mistaken for its spine by researchers who found its fossils. Bastiodon has lived in the same habitats as Rampardos , as evidenced by their fossils frequently being found together, possibly from fighting each other to the death.",

It will be dotted with reddish-brown rocks, and have chains of pebbles for arms and a brown tipped beak if it has the Sandy Cloak. When covered by the Trash Cloak, it has a pink-tipped beak and long, dark pink ribbons for arms. Wormadam that evolve on cold days are said to form thicker cloaks.",

It has often been seen traveling in fields and mountains. Despite its diet, Mothim is never seen near any flower gardens. This is because, instead of gathering honey on its own, Mothim raids the hives of Combee for honey. It is a male-only species, with Wormadam as its female counterpart.",

            "description": "Combee is a small, flying, insectoid Pok\u00e9mon . Its body consists of three orange, hexagonal sections that resemble honeycomb cells, arranged with two hexagons on top and the remaining hexagon between and below them. Each hexagon has a round, yellow face with two black, oval eyes and a black, curved mouth. In the middle of their foreheads, the upper two faces each have a single whisker-thin, black antenna with black, oval tips approximately the size of their eyes. They also each have a translucent, rounded-triangle-shaped wing connected to an orange, domed joint on their sides. The backsides of the upper faces are yellow and rounded, as the sides of a sphere. The bottom face is the main thinker of the three, and it is also the only one to have a full, insectoid abdomen. This abdomen is yellow near the tip with a thick, black stripe close to its hexagonal frame. Female Combee have red, wedge-shaped spots on the foreheads of their lower faces, just below the point where all three faces meet; male Combee have no distinct markings in this area.\nSimilar to other Pok\u00e9mon with multiple heads, such as Dugtrio and Dodrio , Combee's trio of faces each have their own consciousness. For example, each face has a different taste in nectar, and Combee can fly only when the top two faces coordinate the flapping of their wings. Each Combee's trio of faces has been together since birth.\nUnlike bees in real life, the vast majority of Combee are male. However, Combee are otherwise similar to bees in their social behavior. They are mostly sociable among their own kind, and form groups of about a hundred individuals. They are generally harmless to others, as they tend to flee when threatened. From sunrise to sunset, Combee will collect nectar to create Honey wherever they can. Beautifly often provides trouble by driving away any Combee that tries to collect near it. Though Combee produce Honey for multiple purposes, they usually consume it. Each swarm of Combee makes a different flavor of honey. When not gathering nectar, Combee will protect their queen Vespiquen . They are very suggestible and will never defy the orders of their queen. When a Vespiquen feels threatened, its Combee will not think twice about risking their lives to protect their queen, to the point of aggressively attacking or even killing the threat. Combee commonly live in caves and hollow trees of forests and other natural, secluded areas with their queen. Combee sleep by creating a hive with other Combee, locking together into a tessellated wall to feel safe in larger numbers. Teddiursa and Mothim regularly raid Combee nests for the Honey they collected.\nPrior to Generation V , Honey Gather was Combee's signature Ability .",

            "description": "Vespiquen is a bee-like Pok\u00e9mon with a typical insect-like, three-part body, i.e. divided into an abdomen, thorax, and head. It has a yellow- and black-striped abdomen, which flares out from a thin, waist-like protrusion under its thorax in a manner that resembles an elegant ballgown. Underneath the expansive abdomen are seven orange, honeycomb-like cells that serve as a nest for baby Combee ; the centermost cell, however, surrounds what appears to be a slender, yellow, more insect-like abdomen, which is often obscured by the \u2018gown\u2019 part of its abdomen. Vespiquen has black arms that each consist of two thin, conical segments. Each arm ends in two small, orange claws. It flies with a pair of relatively small wings, each of which consists of two stacked, translucent teardrop segments. Vespiquen's arms and wings attach to its round thorax, which is yellow on the front, black on the back, and orange on each side where its arms attach. A curved line on its back, between its orange shoulders, separates its thorax and waist. Vespiquen's head consists of its face and horns. Its orange face has intimidating red eyes; yellow mandibles that protrude from its face and connect to its horns; and a large, red gem on its forehead. Vespiquen's horns are yellow near its face and black at the tips, and with the gem, they resemble historical headpieces or crowns worn by European royal and noble women in the Late Middle Ages, such as the escoffion .\nSimilar to queen bees in real life, Vespiquen is a female-only species. Vespiquen is the sole queen of a hive of Combee, which it commands by releasing pheromones. The more pheromones Vespiquen produces, the more Combee it will have in its hive. As queen, Vespiquen gives birth to and raises Combee grubs, feeding on flowers to make honey for its progeny; it also controls and protects its hive. It is far more powerful than its Combee, and it will only take direct action if its Combee are unable to protect the hive; even so, the Combee will defend their Vespiquen even to the point of death. Vespiquen will destroy and feed on any outsiders it catches sneaking into its hive. However, if outsiders prove themselves to a Vespiquen by defending its hive, it may repay these acts of kindness with a reward.\nVespiquen is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Attack Order , Defend Order , and Heal Order .",

A female Pachirisu's blue stripe is shorter than a male's. A large white tooth grows out of its mouth. It has deep gray eyes and a yellow circle on each cheek. Its tail is almost twice as big as its body, with three spikes at the top of the curl, which it can use to shoot charges. Though its arms and legs are very short, it can run incredibly fast, enabling it to tire pursuing Pok\u00e9mon out quickly. It has a great amount of electricity flowing within its body. If it builds up enough charge, it may shock other Pok\u00e9mon. It is related to the Pikachu line.\nWhen it sleeps, Pachirisu likes to curl its big, fluffy tail round to the front of its body and uses it as a pillow. It also likes to chase and groom its tail. When a Pachirisu sheds its fur it shapes them into furballs, which have static charges just like its fur. It hides its favorite foods \u2014which mainly consist of berries\u2014in these static puffs and stores them in tree holes. It does this to protect the food; if a human or another Pok\u00e9mon tries to take the food, they will get shocked from the static. It may rub cheek pouches with another Pachirisu to share stored electricity. It is generally found in treetops in forests, as well as the outskirts of a forest and near power plants.",

Buizel has a cream-colored spot above each eye and two black parallel marks on its cheeks. The underside of its face and stomach are also cream-colored, as are the tips of its two tails. A male Buizel has two cream-colored spots on their back, while a female has only one.\nBuizel's yellow collar is a flotation sac that can be inflated when it inhales. By doing so, Buizel can keep its face above water to watch for prey movement or survey its surroundings. Conversely, it deflates this sac in order to dive. Its tails can spin to act as a propeller, allowing it to swim and slice through obstacles like seaweed. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Diamond and Pearl episode Mounting a Coordinator Assault! , it is also shown to be able to fly using its spinning tail. Buizel usually lives alongside bodies of water.",

Its feet are small in comparison to the rest of the body. It has two pointed blue fins on its arms; two aligned, backward-swept, pointed fins on its head; and two tails, which can spin like a propeller in a similar way to its pre-evolution's. It has cream colorations on its forehead, eyelids, muzzle, belly, and the tips of its forelimbs and tails. It also has one cream, slightly protruding, oval-shaped spot on its back if it is female, and two of these spots if it is male. There is an orange teardrop shape near the bottom of its belly, and a pattern of two black triangles on the edges of its muzzle. It has small, sharp canine teeth, the top two of which can be seen when its mouth is closed.\nFloatzel has a yellow flotation sac, which seems to behave similar to rubber. The flotation sac goes in a kind of ring behind its head, down in front of its arms, then back behind its rear above the tails. Floatzel's sac developed as a result of chasing prey in the water. To help it dive, Floatzel can deflate its flotation sac, and then inflate it once again when it wishes to surface. Floatzel's sac allows it to not drown, even in stormy seas. Along with hunting for food, Floatzel can use its swimming capabilities to assist in the rescues of drowning people, by carrying them like a raft. It is often seen near fishing hamlets.",

Cherubi has a short stem with two big, green leaves and a second, much smaller head growing out of it. This second head is vestigial in terms of function, but it contains nutrients that contribute to Cherubi's growth as its initial source of food. The second head is apparently edible and has a sweet taste, and several Pok\u00e9mon such as Starly have been seen trying to pluck it off. When the second head begins to bloom and wilt, it means Cherubi is close to evolving. The second head detaches after Cherubi evolves, which become food for other creatures.

            "description": "Shellos is a sea slug -like Pok\u00e9mon whose appearance changes depending on which part of the sea it is found in. Both forms have amorphous, slug-like bodies, black oval-shaped eyes with yellow outlines, minuscule, dot-shaped noses, and wide yellow lips. Like real-world sea slugs, they have mantles covering the top halves of their bodies. These mantles are outlined in yellow, similar to their eyes. Unlike real sea slugs, however, they have bulbous heads and four small feet rather than one large foot.\nThe West Sea form's underside is white, and its mantle is pink, with several small spike-like protrusions on its back. On its head is a ring of pink, fleshy knobs resembling the gills of a nudibranch . West Sea Shellos' appearance is theorized to have been influenced by warm ocean waters.\nThe East Sea form, meanwhile, sports a green underside and a turquoise mantle. Two yellow-lined, flap-like protrusions, resembling cerata , are present along its back. On its head are two white-tipped tentacles resembling rhinophores that extend away from its face. East Sea Shellos's appearance is theorized to have been influenced by cold ocean waters.\nShellos lives along seashores; its color becomes more vibrant the better quality of the waters it lives in. It is also believed that Shellos's diet, which consists of plankton, also influences its form, though this has yet to be proven. The physical differences between both forms appear largely cosmetic; no significant changes in capabilities have been observed. While it can travel onto land, it can only stay on the shore for a limited time before its skin dries out. When Shellos' squishy body is pressed or squeezed, or when Shellos senses imminent danger, a mysterious purple fluid \u2014 theorized to be a kind of stress-induced greasy sweat \u2014 will ooze out of its body. This fluid is its defense mechanism against enemies; although harmless, it is very sticky and hard to wash off. Shellos has a friendly disposition and is said to have great regenerative capabilities. In the animated series , West Sea Shellos can extend their necks to incredible lengths. It is unknown if the East Sea form can do this as well.\nThis species once had a shell on its back long ago and is considered a close relative to Pok\u00e9mon such as Shellder . The Nurse Joy featured in Gateway to Ruin! revealed Mount Coronet 's formation led to an allopatric speciation event, in which the original population of Shellos was separated into two. As a result, Shellos's color and other physical aspects began to vary due to environmental differences and population isolation over time. The two forms are still able to interbreed; the child normally takes the mother's form but takes the father's if bred with a Ditto . Recently, East Sea Shellos' population has been declining, while West Sea Shellos has become more abundant than before.",

            "description": "Gastrodon is a sea slug -like Pok\u00e9mon . Much like its pre-evolved form, it has a slug-like body with a round head and a mantle covering the top half of its body. It has six stubby legs and two black eyes with white pupils, with a mark imitating a third eye appearing on its forehead. A yellow stripe runs along the edge of its mantle, through its two lower eyes, and around the back of its head. Like Shellos , Gastrodon has two forms based on the sea it lives in.\nIn its West Sea form, it has a pair of large tentacles on its head that curve upward and a smaller, straighter pair on its neck. Its underside is pink, while its mantle is brown, with three pink spots on each side of its back. There are also two lumps on its back, resembling the cerata on real-life sea slugs.\nIn its East Sea form, it retains the head tentacles it had as a Shellos, which are now fully green and angled slightly further upward. Its underside is turquoise, while its mantle is forest green with two turquoise spots on each side. It has a pair of yellow, fin-like cerata on its back and a wavy yellow line bordering its side and rear.\nGastrodon and its pre-evolution Shellos are examples of allopatric speciation , although the two forms can still breed with each other. It is also a relative of Shellder and Cloyster . When threatened, it oozes a purple liquid and flees. While not poisonous, the fluid is very bitter and sticky. Its mucus-coated body is soft and squishy yet surprisingly resilient, and it leaves behind a trail of sticky slime when moving on land. It also has strong regenerative capabilities that allow it to recover from injuries or dismemberment within a few hours. In ancient times, it had a shell on its back, which gradually became a thin yet hard vestigial plate.\nGastrodon lives in shallow tidal pools, beaches, and rocky shorelines. Its diet consists mainly of plankton, but it is occasionally known to move onto land to look for other foods, such as beach sand. When it finds prey, it melts it with mucus before eating them. While Gastrodon cannot stay out of water for too long due to its body being highly vulnerable to dehydration, it becomes more active during cloudy or rainy weather. It has been found on far-off mountains during times of constant rain. The two forms of Gastrodon are known to engage in heated conflict with one another. West Sea Gastrodon was much more numerous in the past than it is in the present. Conversely, East Sea Gastrodon's population has visibly increased in population as of late.",

The tails also have a cuff of a rounded frill on the wrists. The bases of Ambipom's tails also have a similar frill. It has round ears with red insides. Ambipom has an arrangement of split hair sticking out from the top of its head. These strands of hair are longer on a female. It has a purple, triangular nose and wide eyes.\nAmbipom can leap from tree to tree with brilliant speed. To eat, it deftly shucks nuts with its two tails. As it has two hands on its tails, it rarely uses its arms. Ambipom can use their tails to communicate with other Ambipom. Ambipom works in large colonies in heavily wooded areas and makes rings by linking tails with another Ambipom, apparently in friendship. Ambipom has been seen giving rings even to humans sometimes. It also shows affection by using both of its tails to wrap and squeeze people. It lives along with its young, Aipom . It lives high in the treetops of tropical, temperate, and even boreal forests, using its tails for balance as it swings from branch to branch. In the Alola region , while searching for comfortable trees, Ambipom tends to get into territorial disputes with Passimian , in which they win half the time.",

At the base of its body is a frayed protrusion that resembles the tied end of a balloon. In the middle of its face is a yellow tape-like \"X\" mark, which contains its little mouth in the very center. Located on either side of the \"X\" are its small, black eyes. A white mass of fluff that resembles a cloud sits on top of Drifloon's head. Drifloon's body is filled with air, as well as the lost spirits of people and Pok\u00e9mon. Its body expands as it collects more souls. If it explodes, the souls unleash with a screaming sound. It is also rumored that Drifloon itself is reincarnated from deceased humans.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon is known as a \"Signpost for Wandering Spirits\" due to its aimless drifting. Desiring company, Drifloon often seeks out children and grabs their hands. However, due to how light it is, it can be resisted easily and is often pulled around. This results in Drifloon running away from any children who are rough with it. Drifloon also dislikes heavy children. There are rumors that Drifloon steals children who hold onto it, guiding them to the afterlife. Despite this reputation, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Diamond and Pearl episode Drifloon On the Wind! , Drifloon can be friendly and helpful. In the movie The Rise of Darkrai , Drifloon's body puffs up when it gets angry or aggressive. Drifloon sightings are typically more common at night. It prefers to reside in damp, humid locations and can expand or shrink to express its feelings.\nDrifloon and its evolved form, Drifblim , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Flare Boost as an Ability . Prior to Generation V , this was also true for Unburden .",

The colors are separated by a repeated semicircle pattern all around its body. On the top of its head is a puffy, white mass, which closely resembles a cloud. In the center of its body is a large yellow \"X\" mark, and on either side just above the \"X\" are its small, red eyes. On the lower portion of its body are four long, thin arms that extend diagonally in four different directions. Its arms are tipped with yellow and have three short points each. The bottom of its body narrows into a short, red extrusion that fans slightly outward. Drifblim's body contains souls, said to be burdened with regrets. These souls serve as fuel for Drifblim's gas.\nDrifblim is strong enough to lift Pok\u00e9mon or people but has no control over its flight. This causes it to drift with the wind and end up anywhere. It can, however, inflate and deflate itself with gas to control its altitude. It is rarely active during the day but usually gathers in groups during the evenings. When noticed, the groups will suddenly vanish to unknown locations. Drifblim preys on Clamperl . There are rumors of Drifblim carrying people to the afterlife; as well, there have been songs or poems dedicated to Drifblim due to people admiring its transient, melancholy aspect.\nDrifblim and its pre-evolved form, Drifloon , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Flare Boost as an Ability . Prior to Generation V , this was also true for Unburden .",

It has two types of fur covering its body: a light tan fleece that covers much of its lower body, feet, and the tips of its ears, and a smooth, chocolate-colored pelt on the upper half of its body. It has a small, triangular pink nose, pink paw pads on the undersides of its feet, and small tan spots above its eyes. It has a small brown puff of a tail.\nBuneary almost always keeps one of its ears rolled up. Although Professor Laventon had hypothesized that this is done to protect its hearing, in actuality, Buneary rolls its ears so it can quickly unroll them and launch them as an attack. The attack is strong enough to hurt grown-ups and crush boulders and increases in power as Buneary trains to use it. Buneary can also use this technique to jump really high, by slamming its ears towards the ground. Buneary's arms and legs are weaker by comparison. If Buneary senses danger, it perks up both ears; conversely, if Buneary rolls both of its ears in, it is a sign that it is unhealthy. On cold nights, Buneary sleeps with its head tucked into its fur. It lives in forests, though it can also be found on icy mountains.\nPrior to Generation V , Buneary and its evolved form, Lopunny , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Klutz as an Ability .",

Similar tufts of fluffy cream-colored fur cover its wrists, lower legs, and the ends of its long ears, which bend shortly above its head. Lopunny is very proud of these ears and never fails to groom them. If the ears are roughly handled, Lopunny will kick in retaliation.\nLopunny's fur is warm and light, and Lopunny sheds it twice a year. Its winter coat is soft and fluffy, and filled with plenty of insulating air. This fur can be used to make warm mufflers and hats. Lopunny is a timid Pok\u00e9mon that constantly monitors its surroundings, and will cloak its body with its ears or spring away when it senses danger. Despite this, it is capable of unleashing superdestructive kicks with its lithe legs.

If it is powerful, Mismagius can use advanced incantations for various purposes, such as causing misery or happiness. Due to this, people often seek to capture Mismagius as if their life depends on it, solely to make someone fall in love with them. There is a custom on inviting Mismagius to one's home, usually to ward off misfortune with its spells. However, this can also lead to disaster should Mismagius ever be provoked. People that hear its cries will usually receive headaches and hallucinations. As shown in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Diamond and Pearl episode Malice In Wonderland! , Mismagius can put its victims to sleep, and cause them to enter a strange dream world without their noticing. If Mismagius falls asleep or is knocked out, the victim will wake up. It can sometimes be found roaming around lakes and mountainsides at night.",

It has a large feather crest resembling a fedora hat that has spikes extending from the back. It has circular red eyes with white sclerae and dark blue eyelids. Its yellow beak is slightly curved, and its head is supported by a broad, short neck. Honchkrow has a white and prominent crest of feathers on its chest that bears resemblance to a beard or cravat. Its wings have red feathers on the inside. Honchkrow has black feet with four toes. The tail's base is a white, cylindrical stalk, on which there is a growth of red feathers on the end.\nHonchkrow is known to be ruthless. With a mere cry, it can summon and organize a murder of more than one hundred Murkrow to collect food for it. Honchkrow also summons Murkrow to fight on its behalf, letting them do most of the fighting before it deals the finishing blow. The flocks of summoned Murkrow often plunge the sky into pitch-black darkness, giving Honchkrow the moniker, \"Summoner of Night.\" Honchkrow will never forgive any failure or betrayal of the Murkrow that follow it, and it will hunt and punish any member of its flock that does so. Honchkrow is more active at night, and normally spends the daytime hours tending to its feathers in solitude. It is a scavenger that lives in swamps, forests, human towns and cities, and plains.",

Its feet are tipped with white and have pink paw pads on the underside. It has a long, curled, spring-shaped tail and a white fluff at the tip of it.\nGlameow has sharp claws and a powerful helical tail, and its eyes are capable of using hypnotic powers. It tends to be spiteful, fickle, and even cowardly, having a tendency to hook its claws into the nose of its trainer if it's not fed. When it's happy and purring with affection, it demonstrates movements with its tail, like a dancing ribbon. As it has a domesticated quality, it tends to appear in urban areas. Glameow is rather popular amongst trainers due to its fickle nature. Glameow is also known to be a very cunning opponent to face in battle, which occurs only if it was provoked. Because of its craven nature, Glameow has a high chance of fleeing trainers when encountered in the wild.",

There are circular openings on both sides of its mouth.\nInside its mouth is a red orb, which creates a ringing sound as the Pok\u00e9mon moves. Additionally, the orb can be vibrated to create high-frequency, long-lasting cries to deafen its opponents. The sounds produced can be too high for people to hear, yet powerful enough to give them headaches. Atop its body is ring-like growth with a striped rope through the middle. The rope is red-and-white with short tassels on the ends.",

Its tail is raised high and ends with spiked hair pointed behind it. It has a cream-colored underbelly, and four short legs, that end in paws with three small, white claws.\nStunky can spray a foul-smelling liquid from its rear in order to drive attackers away, which is able to reach up to 16 feet (5 meters) away. It prefers to aim for its target's face. The stench can be smelled from over a mile (2 kilometers) away, and will linger for around 24 hours. The stench can cause memory loss.",

Its legs are tan, and the tan coloration of its underside now forms a spiky pattern. Its nose is larger than its pre-evolution. Its massive tail, which has a cream-colored stripe, sits on top of its back and head.\nSkuntank is known for its noxious fluid which smells dreadful. It can spray this fluid over 160 feet (50 meters), and the longer it allows the liquid to ferment within its belly, the more powerful the smell. Unlike its pre-evolution and real-life skunks, which spray fluids from their rears, Skuntank sprays its fluid from its tail tip, which can open. The stench of Skuntank's fluid varies depending on its diet. Skuntank prefers to nest in large, prickly bushes in heavily wooded areas and digs holes in the ground to make its nest. While Skuntank can use its poisonous fluids to take down prey, ironically it cannot handle the smell of its own stench, abandoning potential defeated meals as a result.",

It was first seen in ancient tombs and timeworn places; objects resembling this Pok\u00e9mon have also been found in tombs. Scientists believe Bronzor used to be reflective and have unsuccessfully tried performing X-rays on its body. The pattern of Bronzor in Galar cannot be found in any of its cultures, and the reason is unknown. There is lore on how polishing Bronzor will make its surface reflect the truth. However, it hates being polished. Bronzor uses an unknown energy to help it float around.

            "description": "Bronzong is a large Pok\u00e9mon resembling a blue-green bell with two arms coming out of its sides. It has a hollow body and a yoke attached at the top. Its face can be best described as being a \" Totem Pole \" design; Bronzong has two round, red eyes with blue-green irises and a rectangular mouth with one visible row of square teeth. It also has several darker, rectangular markings on its body.\nWhen angered, Bronzong lets out a warning cry that rings out like the tolling of a bell. It can summon rain clouds, which earned it the nickname \"bringer of plentiful harvests\" and led to some referring to it as a deity since ancient times. Bronzong's cry is also believed to have the power to open a hole leading to other worlds. Many scientists believe the Bronzong found in Galar originated from a different region after researching the patterns on its body. Some Bronzong can sleep up to 2,000 years, with one such case leading to quite the media story when one was discovered at a construction site. Bronzong typically lives in ruins and mountain ranges.\nPrior to Generation VIII , Bronzong and its pre-evolved form, Bronzor , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Heatproof as an Ability .",

There are three yellow spots on its face, two of which surround its eyes, which are small black dots. It has short legs and toeless feet. Bonsly also has a hole on its rear similar to the draining hole of a flowerpot. It is often mistaken for a Grass-type , but its body is biologically closer to stone.\nBonsly is a good mimic, making it often mistaken for a real bonsai tree, though it can easily stand out in a dry environment that lacks greenery. As its green spheres dry out, their dull luster increases. It can remain in the same spot for a long time. It also has a habit of crying, not because it is sad or needing attention, but rather it is due to excess moisture in its body. As it cries, it expels both sweat and tears from its eyes; Bonsly sweat tastes a little salty, while the tears are slightly bitter. It dies if it gets too damp with this moisture. This habit also gets enemies to let their guards down. It prefers dry, rock-strewn areas, but it isn't uncommon to see one in a garden. As suggested by Brock's Bonsly , a very young Bonsly needs to be bottle-fed but can eat solid food when it matures. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , people tend to think Bonsly is crying in its sleep, and that something is wrong. However, its merely expelling water from its body to adjust its body's fluid levels.",

It has three round bumps on its forehead and two pink circles on its cheeks. There is a pouch around the lower half of its body. The pouch is red with a white stripe around the top.\nHappiny's pouch is rubbery and flexible, enabling the Happiny to put things into it with ease. As it cannot produce Eggs yet, it makes up for it by carrying something round and white in its pouch to imitate Chansey and Blissey , typically an Egg-shaped stone. Happiny highly treasures this stone. It may give this stone to people whom it likes, however, it can throw a tantrum and cry should the stone be taken from it or not returned to it. The object it decides to carry may be too large, stopping this Pok\u00e9mon from moving. It has a habit of wandering around people's feet and causing them to stumble. Happiny enjoys playing with children, often playing a game of House with them. Happiny is shown to be extremely strong in the animated series , as one has been seen lifting heavy things above its head. Happiny is a female-only species with no male counterpart.\nHappiny and its evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Soft-Boiled by leveling up.",

Chatot are even capable of understanding the meaning of the words they mimic, the older and more experienced they become.

            "description": "Spiritomb is a ghostly purple Pok\u00e9mon attached to a stone. Although lacking a physical body, Spiritomb projects its appearance out of a small rock called the Odd Keystone . The rock is trapezoidal in shape and has two small dots. There is a fissure running down the middle, splitting in two near the bottom. The crack in combination with the two dots appears to form a frowning face. Spiritomb's projected appearance is an ethereal composition of swirling purple energy of an unknown kind. Its face is set in the middle of the purple, and contains green, crescent eyes that are connected to its jagged mouth. Its pupils are composed of a spiral and it is sometimes only seen with one. Swirling around its face are green orbs with yellow centers.\nSpiritomb is formed by a collection of 108 spirits, some of which are ill-natured. This collection of spirits is known for its misdeeds; thus, as punishment, the spirits were trapped to its Odd Keystone by a traveler using a mysterious spell. Several Pok\u00e9dex entries state that Spiritomb was sealed roughly 500 years before the present time. The Pok\u00e9mon lays curses with its wicked thoughts. It will lash out at anyone with little thought, often exercising short-sightedness in its pursuit of vengeance. It is rarely encountered in the wild. In most media, Spiritomb moves its body primarily through levitation; though in the core series games, it can only appear to do so through dragging the Odd Keystone across the ground.\nPapers found within Sea Mauville in Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire state that it was donated from the Oreburgh Mine , suggesting that several Odd Keystones meant to contain Spiritomb can be found in the Underground of Sinnoh. Professor Cozmo 's father, Raizoh, was responsible for misplacing it when working on the ship. [1]\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus, Spiritomb's 108 spirits appear in the form of Wisps , small purple entities scattered across the Hisui region after a seal was broken. When 107 Wisps have been taken to a large Odd Keystone shrine at the Crimson Mirelands ' Shrouded Ruins as per Vessa 's request, she will provide the player with the final Wisp and disappear, with a wild Spiritomb appearing shortly afterwards.\nAs depicted in The Keystone Pops! , Spiritomb can be just as aggressive and destructive as the spirits that it is composed of. The Spectral Express! also revealed that anyone possessed by one of Spiritomb's spirits will start to cause misdeeds, and their face will eventually start to resemble Spiritomb. Losing one of these spirits will cause Spiritomb to go on an uncontrollable rampage until the lost spirit is returned.",

It has a big mouth filled with sharp teeth, no neck, and arms that start at the outer edges of its jaws. Its stomach is relatively small compared to its mouth. A red underbelly stretches from its abdomen to the bottom of its jaw. Gible has two horns that resemble jet or plane engines, each with a light blue stripe in the middle. It has a single light blue stripe wrapping around its back, and a short tail. On top of its head is a dorsal fin, which has a notch on it for the male. Its dorsal fin is strong enough to carry a person.\nIn the past, Gible lived in the tropics. Gible appears to be a good digger, making deep holes for homes in caverns warmed by geothermal heat. This heated environment allows Gible to survive even during the winter. It has also been seen huddling with other members of its species to stave off the cold, although it enjoys play-fighting with them as well. Gible is typically sighted in rocky areas, such as mountains.\nGible has tremendously strong jaws that it uses to bite enemies and prey alike, dragging the latter back into its nest. However, even while biting, it often hurts itself because of clumsiness. This sometimes causes its teeth to chip and fall off in the process, but Gible is never bothered by this because the teeth will grow back after a few days. As shown in the animated series , Gible is capable of eating through most types of metal.\nIn Generation IX , Gible and its evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Rough Skin as an Ability .",

            "description": "Garchomp is a bipedal, draconian Pok\u00e9mon that is primarily dark blue in color. It has red on its underbelly from the lower jaw to the middle of the abdomen, including the undersides of its arms. A patch of gold comes to a point below the red on its belly, and a golden star shape adorns the tip of its snout. Garchomp has horn-like appendages that resemble a jet or plane 's engines, giving it an appearance similar to a hammerhead shark . These horns allow it to sense its prey from a long distance. Its large mouth features razor-sharp teeth. The feet have three white talons, and each arm has a single large, white claw for a hand. Curved fins sprout from the arms, creating wings that allow Garchomp to fly. Garchomp also has a large dorsal fin and another on its tail that resembles a shark tailfin . The male's dorsal fin has a notch on it. Pairs of small, white spikes protrude from its upper arms and legs, and there are gill-like slits on the sides of the neck. The eyes are intense, with black sclerae and gold-colored irises.\nGarchomp can fly at an incredible speed to catch its prey, being capable of flying as fast as a jet, cutting down trees with its blades of wind, a magnificent sight to witness. It is able to move in both the air and underground. It preys on bird Pok\u00e9mon and is known to eat entire flocks of them whole. It sometimes battles Salamence in the air as they compete for food. After catching prey, it returns to its den before its body can cool down. The fine scales on its body reduce drag for easier flight, and their sharp edges also serve to injure opponents who attack it directly. It can use its protuberances as sensors for finding distinct prey. Garchomp lives in mountainous regions, both volcanic and boreal, and typically dwells underground. However, it is seldom sighted in the wild. Garchomp is described as having a feral nature, requiring extreme caution should anyone encounter it.\nIn Generation IX , Garchomp and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Rough Skin as an Ability .",

Munchlax has two pointy teeth that stick out of its mouth even if closed.\nIt is a hyperactive Pok\u00e9mon. It does not mind walking and running from place to place as it looks for food, but it is usually very slow-moving. Munchlax tends to store food in its long fur, although it sometimes forgets about its hidden food. Its stomach allows it to eat nearly anything, even rotten food, and they are indifferent to flavor. It can also eat many servings of food at a time without chewing and rarely gets full. It eats the most food of any Pok\u00e9mon besides its evolution, Snorlax . Munchlax tends to raid villages for food intended to be thrown away.",

It has a black \"mask\" and red eyes. It stands on its toes instead of its entire foot. It is sensitive to a special type of energy called Aura ; however, it does not have the ability to fully use these powers, although it can still emanate these waves to communicate and sense them, albeit only in ripples. It has developed two black appendages that hang down from its head, which rise when Riolu reads or manipulates aura. It has even been seen that Riolu can sense and react to Aura before they even hatch. The aura emitting from Riolu's body grows even stronger when it is frightened or sad.\nLike most Fighting-type Pok\u00e9mon, Riolu naturally has superhuman strength, stamina, and endurance. It is capable of making long journeys on foot in a short amount of time. It is a playful, energetic, and loyal Pok\u00e9mon. It is also known to be tough and hard working. Riolu will read the minds of humans to assure whether or not they are pure of heart. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Riolu tends to sleep in a unsual position. This position is sitting up while not lying down, similar to Lucario. It is believed that Riolu is pushing itself hard and dreaming of the day it evolves into Lucario.",

It possesses a short, round spike on the back of each forepaw, in addition to a third on its chest. It has red eyes, a long snout, and ears. When its mouth is open, two pairs of pointed teeth, one in the upper jaw and one in the lower, can be seen. It possesses cream-colored fur on its torso and blue fur on its thighs that resemble shorts. It has a medium-length tail of the same blue color as well. It stands on its toes rather than on its entire foot. It has developed four black appendages that hang down from its head, which rise when Lucario reads or manipulates aura , a special energy that it senses. Lucario can use its powers to create a staff in form a bone and use it to fight.\nLucario can study auras to predict the movements of its opponents and track their quarry. With sufficient training, a Lucario can read auras to understand how living beings are feeling from more than half a mile (1 kilometer) away. However, it sometimes ends up learning information that it would not like to know, causing it to get stressed out easily. It also has the power to manipulate this energy in an offensive manner, in the form of explosive spheres of energy . Lucario can understand human speech and has been reported to communicate with humans through telepathy.\nLucario is considered to be prideful and is extremely loyal to its Trainer . It also seems to have a natural sense of justice, as it only trusts Trainers with righteous hearts. It is an exceptionally rare Pok\u00e9mon that usually lives deep in mountains very far from people to improve their skills. Lucario are primarily carnivores, hunting their prey in packs, though one Lucario was seen eating Berries and plants like roses. It has also been seen eating chocolate, even though chocolate is not part of its natural diet. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Lucario never lowers its guard, even when sleeping. It is believed Lucario's reading the aura of others similar to when it's awake.",

Its skin color depends on gender: if male, it is tan with mottled dark brown patches, and if female, its coloring is reversed. It has a large snout with round, protruding nostrils, and several blunt teeth inside its mouth. Its eyes and small ears protrude from the top of its head. It has a small hole on its back. Each of its feet has two blunt claws, and it has a small tail.\nHippopotas spends its time bathing in sand and avoids water at all costs. It covers itself in sand as a protective measure against germs and expels sand instead of sweat. When it walks through the sand, it shuts its nostrils but keeps its mouth open, swallowing any sand and prey along the way. It removes excess sand in its body from its nostrils, which it also does when angered or excited. Hippopotas is more active during the day, and burrows into sand during the night to avoid the cold. It prefers to travel in groups of ten. Despite its large and heavy appearance, it may remain undetected, due to how well it hides in the sand.",

Hippowdon also has black feet with four blunt, flat claws each.\nHippowdon is short-tempered, easily provoked into violence, and may hold its mouth agape as a display of strength. Hippowdon's jaws are capable of crushing cars. Hippowdon stores sand in its body, which is used to create twisters when attacking. Excess sand is expelled out of the ports on Hippowdon's back and nostrils to create room for fresh sand to ingest, in order for it to stay healthy. It has a symbiotic relationship with Dwebble , which clears any stones stuck in its ports while the Hippowdon cares for the Dwebble helping it in exchange. Drapion are known to stay away from Hippowdon. It typically lives in deserts, but can also survive in swampy terrain.",

However, it is capable of surviving for a year without nourishment. Skorupi is related to Sizzlipede through a common ancestor. Skorupi is found in deserts and dry areas like Reversal Mountain , though it can be found in marshy areas such as the Great Marsh .

Drapion has two small, pointed protrusions between its eyes, and one on the back of its head. Drapion also has protrusions on its jaws, two on the upper and three on the lower, with large, fang-like, white-colored features extending from its mouth. Its body is composed of many violet-to-lavender body segments which end with a tail with two stingers. Drapion has four segmented legs with pointed toes. Its most distinguishing feature is its huge claws. It can turn its head 180 degrees.\nDrapion is a very aggressive Pok\u00e9mon, attacking anything that enters its territory. It primarily lives in deserts and otherwise rocky environments. Drapion has a sturdy build and takes pride in its strength, being able to take down foes even without the use of its deadly toxin. Drapion has enough power to easily scrap a car, while its hard, armor-like skin can deflect sword strikes. Due to its vicious nature and brutish temperament, it's known as the Sand Demon , but is known to avoid fights with Hippowdon . Drapion tends to go on rampages and causes havoc on anything in its way.",

There are orange, expandable pouches on its cheeks, and its teeth are wide and flat. A black marking encircles its upper arms and chest, and there are white bands around its chest. The white markings are slightly higher up on the female Croagunk than the male. It has three fingers and toes, most of which are black. The only digits that are not black are its center fingers, which are orange instead.\nCroagunk's cheek pouches and fingers contain a poisonous fluid. However, the fluid squeezed from its finger is also a significant ingredient in remedies for lower back pain once diluted. The cheek pouches can be used to create an unnerving sound. When its opponents are distracted, it tries to stab them with its fingers. Despite this, it fights others only to ensure its own survival. Croagunk is a popular Pok\u00e9mon due to being chosen as a mascot for a pharmaceutical company. It is also popular thanks to its strange cry and comical look. Croagunk and its evolved form, Toxicroak, are related to Seismitoad . Croagunk is said to have a dastardly nature, due to wielding poison. It usually lives in swamps and forested areas. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Croagunk has been observed inflating its poison sack cheeks while sleeping. On occasion, the sound from its poison sacs will wake it up.",

Its eyes are bright yellow, sinister and intimidating, with a small snake-like pupil. Its mouth gives an appearance of a mouth-guard, with its red upper lip curling upward at the ends in a very intimidating manner. Underneath its chin is a bulbous red vocal sac, which is smaller on a female Toxicroak. It has three fingers and one large red claw on the back of each hand. These claws on the backs of their hands can channel poison. Its forearms have two black rings encircling them. Its legs are muscular and seem to be adapted for speedy attacks. It has three toes on its feet, with a red middle toe on each foot, and a sharp spike that juts out of its heels. Underneath the pelvic area are two white horizontal lines. Thick black lines run down the sides of its body and surrounding its limbs, making them seem as if the limbs are detachable. The black lines go up into its face and surround the eyes before meeting in the middle of its snout, just above the upper lip.\nBy croaking, Toxicroak churns the poison stored in the poison sac on their throat for more potency. Toxicroak gives off poison with stings or claws, though it can poison when touched. This poison can knock an opponent out or even prove fatal, even if it is just a scratch. Toxicroak's poison can be diluted into a tonic, after mixing it with various wild grass, and cooking it for about two days. Toxicroak releases a victory croak when a foe is defeated. It can be cruel and fearsome, or it can be quite laid-back, relaxing on rocks and in marshes, studying the views around it. Toxicroak and its pre-evolved form, Croagunk, are related to Seismitoad . Toxicroak lives in moist areas around bodies of water. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Toxicroak occasionally uses the poison sac at its throat as a cushion while it slumbers. However, apporaching a sleeping Toxicroak will result in it suddenly punching its fists out without warning. It is believed that it is practicing Poison Jab while dreaming.",

            "description": "Finneon is a small fishlike Pok\u00e9mon with an ellipsoid body. The bottom half of its body is light-blue while the top half is black. A pink stripe runs across either side of Finneon's horizontal length. It has small blue pectoral fins, two black oval-shaped dorsal fins, and pink eyes. Finneon's most notable feature is the pair of caudal fins that resemble a pair of blue butterfly wings with pink spots. The bottom lobes of a female Finneon's tail fin are bigger than a male's. Finneon's pink stripes and spots can absorb sunlight, which allows those areas to shine vividly at night. Finneon shines itself as a form of camouflage, as well as to attract prey.\nBecause of its wing-like fins and beautiful appearance, Finneon is known as \"The Beautifly of the Sea\" and \"finery fish\". It lives in bodies of water, and it travels in schools, sometimes with Lumineon . Finneon is popular with divers; as a result, it is found living near resorts that feed them. It swims near the surface during the day to absorb sunlight, then dives into deeper waters at night. It is able to jump high and breach the water's surface with its tail fins, where it is then caught by its natural predator Wingull .",

The light blue markings on Lumineon's pectoral fins are able to emit light. There is a band of light blue running vertically around its body. Its tail is long with a deep pink spot at the tip, and it has a pair of light blue pelvic fins.\nLumineon are known to travel in schools, and although it can be found near the water's surface, it usually makes its home deep in the ocean, where it walks along the seafloor using the fins on its chest. This behavior helps it to avoid predators. Lumineon attracts its prey by flashing the patterning on its wing-like fins, although this behavior also attracts ferocious fish Pok\u00e9mon that Lumineon itself is prey to. It typically competes with Lanturn for food, such as Staryu and Starmie .",

Edible white Berries grow along Snover's midsection. It usually grows the berries when spring approaches.\nIn Galar , packs of its natural predator, Galarian Darumaka , enjoy eating the Berries produced by Snover. This results in Abomasnow often chasing them away in order to protect it. Snover lives on snowy peaks in warm seasons but migrates lower as the weather cools. A curious Pok\u00e9mon, it often approaches people and can be found inspecting footprints in the snow. There are stories of Snover visiting human settlements, often bonding with the children there. Snover can sink its feet into the snow to absorb water, this helps cool down its body temperature. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Pok\u00e9mon tend to sneak upon the sleeping Snover to consume the berries it grows. Snover is unaware of this while it sleeps.\nPrior to Generation VI , Snover and its evolved form, Abomasnow , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Snow Warning as an Ability .",

            "description": "Abomasnow is a large, bipedal Pok\u00e9mon covered in shaggy, white fur. It has pale purple eyes with bushy eyebrows and long strands of fur covering its mouth. Two tufts of longer fur grow on both its back and chest, with the chest fur being longer on the female. Its hands, feet, and tail are dark green and spiky, similar to the foliage of an evergreen tree. On its back are four green spikes that resemble pinecones.\nAbomasnow lives in snowy mountains and appears only when snow flowers bloom. Once the flowers die, it retreats to isolated areas because Abomasnow prefers to be alone and not associate with others. It is able to create blizzards to hide itself and can also cause whiteout conditions with just a shake of its massive body. Abomasnow is also known as the \"Ice Monster\" and \"abominable snowman\". It protects Snover from packs of Galarian Darumaka , who chase them for the Berries they grow, by swinging its arms like hammers. Abomasnow is powerful enough to split huge boulders in two. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , a sleeping Abomasnow can still cause blizzards by occasionally swinging its arms. Researchers acknowledged that it is unknown why Abomasnow does this, though it is theorized that it is either a habit to hide itself or just sleepy flailing.\nPrior to Generation VI , Abomasnow and its pre-evolved form, Snover , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Snow Warning as an Ability .",

It has a bright red crown and collar made of wide feathers and a single, thinner feather on each ear. The ear feathers are smaller on a female Weavile. Weavile has two tail feathers and three claws on each paw. There is an oval, yellow gem-like protrusion in the center of its forehead. Its eyes are red with three eyelashes, and four fangs protrude from its upper jaw. Weavile is distantly related to Sneasler from the Hisui region.\nWeavile live in snow-covered areas and are notorious predators. Weavile is famed for its speed and agility. Weavile is also known for its intelligence and cunning nature, thanks to its brain having developed as it evolves from Sneasel . A scratch from Weavile's sharp claws can cause frostbite. Weavile travel in packs of four or five, with one of them acting as the pack leader. They hunt for prey such as Alolan Sandshrew , Alolan Vulpix , and even larger species like Mamoswine , then divide up the prey amongst themselves. Weavile can communicate with each other by carving patterns into trees, ice, and boulders, with over 500 distinct signs recorded.",

            "description": "Magnezone is a robot-like Pok\u00e9mon which resembles a UFO. It's the result of Magneton leveling up in the presence of a special magnetic field. The Evolution is done on a molecular level, but despite this, scientists have failed at attempts to force it. Magnezone's tough steel body is wide and circular, similar to a disc or saucer, with a thin edge circling the diameter of its body. Its main eye is in the center, containing a large, red pupil. On each side of its body, it has a ball-shaped addition that resembles a Magnemite, with each side containing an eye, horseshoe magnet, and Phillips head screw. These secondary eyes can move independently of its main eye, as shown in Confronting the Darkness! . On top of its head is a tall, thin, yellow rod, closely resembling an antenna, which it uses for certain attacks. Behind its body is a third horseshoe magnet, positioned like a tail.\nMagnezone's Evolution is theorized to have been caused by a special magnetic field that changed the molecular structure within its body. Magnezone is a seemingly-mechanical, gender unknown creature, but it has emotions, a way of reproducing, and the need for nourishment. With its magnets, it has the ability to control anti-gravity and float through the air at will. As seen in Giratina and the Sky Warrior and Phantom Thief Pok\u00e9mon 7 , Magnezone's anti-gravity is strong enough to carry humans with ease. Magnezone is rarely sighted in the wild. As seen in Regaining the Home Advantage! , Magnezone can be very aggressive and territorial, although it will rarely attack without provocation. It flies through the night sky, often mistaken for a UFO sighting, though it seems to be receiving and sending signals from an unknown source and an unknown purpose. This leads some people to believe that Magnezone came from outer space and that it is being controlled by unknown beings. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Magnezone's screws and magnets will spin while it sleeps. It is believed that a sleepying Magnezone is emiting signals of unknown purpose and receiving signals of unknown origin. However, researchers are divided on if this point is true or not.",

It uses its tongue with more skill than it would its hands and feet, and a current record of its stretch length exceeds 82 feet. Its tongue can also function with the same dexterity as a human hand. However, Lickilicky is rather clumsy with its own fingers.",

            "description": "Rhyperior is a large, brownish-gray Pok\u00e9mon with two horns: a larger one on its nose, and smaller one above it. The upper horn is even smaller on a female Rhyperior. The larger horn is divided into three sections by two thin slanted rings, making the horn resemble a drill. Its hide is partially covered by orange, rocky plates on its head, shoulders, arms, waist, and knees, similar to that of the protector used to evolve it from Rhydon. The hide of Rhyperior's armor has a mysterious substance. It has blade-like protrusions on its elbows and has holes in the palms of its hands which work as cannons or guns. It has three blunt, gray fingers on each hand, two gray toes on each foot, and a club-like tail. Its eyes have red irises with what appears be two thick, rectangular rocks above each one, resembling heavy eyebrows.\nRhyperior is even stronger than Rhydon, although its brain structure is smaller. It can insert rocks and boulders into its arms through the holes in its hands and fire them as projectiles. Occasionally, it will insert and fire Geodude or Roggenrola by accident. Rhyperior has a very hard carapace; it can survive volcanic eruptions, cannot be scratched even by a masterwork sword, and deflect most incoming attacks. This can throw the opponent off balance before it drills into the foe. Rhyperior lives far up in the mountains.\nPrior to Generation V and in Generation IX , Rhyperior is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Rock Wrecker .",

A pair of saucer-like eyes peek out from beneath the tangled mess of vines. Its stubby black feet are tipped with red. Tangrowth has a pair of blue boneless arms that have three fingers. The arms are made from bundles of vines. These fingers are completely red on a female Tangrowth, while they have red tips on a male.\nTangrowth is unfazed if one of its arms is broken off, as it will easily grow back. It hunts by disguising itself as a shrub, then grabbing prey with its vines. However, Tangrowth has been known to eat fruit as well. It can extend its arms as much as it wants. Predators like to eat Tangrowth's vines. When the climate is warm, its vine growth is accelerated to the point where not even its eyes can be seen. If its vines grow too long, Tangrowth shortens them by tearing bits of them off. Tangrowth is very rare in the wild, though it can be found in temperate grasslands.",

The fur on its cheeks and shoulders is spiky and ruffled. It has two black tails with red rounded ends, resembling open electrical wires. Electivire has black feet with three, clawed toes, and five black fingers on each of its hands.\nElectivire is said to have the best electrical-energy output of all Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon and has very impressive physical strength. Electivire is known to be recklessly careless regarding enemy attacks. The tips of its tails, which generate electricity, shock opponents on contact with over 20,000 volts. It can also electrify its punches by gripping onto its tails. Blue sparks fly between its antennae as its electric charge amplifies. It thumps its chest when excited, causing thunder and sparks to fly around it. The voltage it makes can increase when it is battling. The amount of electric energy it can produce depends on the Electivire's pulse. Electivire usually feeds off electric currents. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire episode Home is Where the Start Is! , Electivire was shown eating fruits from trees. A single Electivire is capable of powering a large city for an entire year.\nPrior to Generation V , Electivire was the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Motor Drive as an Ability .",

            "description": "Magmortar is a large, vaguely humanoid, red-and-yellow-striped Pok\u00e9mon with an egg-shaped body. It has pink lips on its dark face. It has yellow, tubular arms with a black \"band\" on both and three small claws on the black part of each \"hand\". Its legs are small in proportion to its body with pink thighs, red feet, and black shackles around its ankles. It has one large yellow flame on its head, as well as large red flames on its shoulders and tail. Additionally, it has four pink spikes on its back. It has an organ that resembles a magma chamber.\nWhen Magmortar prepares to shoot fire from its hands, its claws are capable of disappearing into its skin, forming a pressurized cannon. It blasts fireballs of over 3,600\u00a0\u00b0F (2,000\u00a0\u00b0C), easily melting through iron and burning foes to a blackened crisp, although Magmortar avoids this method when hunting prey. Magmortar increases its body temperature by inhaling deeply, increasing the fire burning with its belly. When firing, its body can turn into a whitish hue from the intense heat. Its arm starts melting when it fires a whole barrage. Magmortar is used in some factories in order to process metal. It lives in volcanic craters, with a single pair of male and female Magmortar occupying one.",

On the back of its head are three spikes: a red-tipped one on the right, a blue-tipped one on the left, and a pure white one in the middle. Togekiss has a relatively flat face and small, black eyes.\nTogekiss have long been known worldwide as bringers of blessings, being depicted on good-luck charms since ancient times. It is said that Togekiss brings good luck simply by virtue of its existence. However, they only appear in peaceful places and have never been witnessed anywhere near conflict or turmoil, making their recent sightings exceptionally rare. It shares many kind gifts and sweet blessings when it visits peaceful places or sees people who avoid strife and respect the rights of others. However, Togekiss is a capable fighter, and can use a powerful energy wave in battle. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , seeing several Togekiss sleeping contently is a sign that peace reigns in the area.",

Yanmega has six black thin legs. It has four white, oval wings with red tips, and there are two smaller white wings on the end of its tail.\nYanmega can create shock waves by beating its wings. These shock waves are so powerful, they may inflict critical injuries on any foes or even knock down huge trees. Yanmega's wings are powerful enough to carry an adult human. Yanmega is very rare in the wild, though it can be found in wooded and swampy areas. It has very strong jaw power and bites apart its prey's heads while flying at high speed. Yanmega usually aim for the prey's most vulnerable spot, wasting no energy in the process. Yanmega is said to be an extremely violent Pok\u00e9mon, usually requiring someone of incredible bravery to tame this aggressive bug. When Yanmega needs to rest, it flips its body over and finds a branch to rest on.",

            "description": "Leafeon is a mammalian, quadrupedal Pok\u00e9mon . Its body is tan with dark brown paws. It has a multitude of small green sprouts growing all over its legs, chest, and back, with the longest one on its head, in front of four tan tufts of fur. Leafeon's green ears and tail resemble tattered leaves. It has brown eyes and a small, brown nose.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon's cellular structure is similar to plants, which allows it to perform photosynthesis and purify the air around it by sleeping under the sunlight; it gets its energy in this way instead of eating. It is a pacifistic, quiet Pok\u00e9mon, preferring not to fight, though it will sharpen its hard, leafy tail for the occasions it needs to. The tail's sharpness is said to exceed that of a master-crafted sword, being able to cut down a large tree with one hit. Leafeon's aroma is similar to fresh grass in its youth; as it ages, this fragrance bears more of a resemblance to fallen leaves. The aroma is favored in Galar , where it is used to create a popular perfume. It lives in lush forests that have clean rivers. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , the air produced by a sleeping Leafeon can help any Pok\u00e9mon sleep deeply.\nDuring the development of Generation II , the earliest iteration of Leafeon was a quadrupedal Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon with root-like feet, several markings across its body, and a short fringe above its eyes. Its eventual redesign for Generation IV is evidenced by Leafeon's early Japanese name in the data of Pok\u00e9mon Battle Revolution matching the same name as this early iteration from Generation II, known as R\u012bfi (\u30ea\u30fc\u30d5\u30a3) .

A teal crest with two dangling flaps adorns its head, resembling hair or headgear. Glaceon has two dark blue, rhombus-shaped markings on its back; the tip of its tail, feet, and flaps are the same shade of blue.\nBy controlling its body temperature, it freezes the moisture in the air, producing ice crystals or diamond dust surrounding it. It is capable of freezing its fur into sharp needle-like icicles, which it can fire at opponents or use as protection as it tackles at its prey. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Glaceon can also perform this defense mechanism while sleeping. It can quickly drop its body temperature below \u221275\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221260\u00a0\u00b0C). Glaceon is rather popular in ski resorts due to its ability to create powdery snow. Those captivated by Glaceon's beautiful snowfall will be instantly frozen without realizing it.",

            "description": "Gliscor is a large, mainly blue-purple vampire bat-like Pok\u00e9mon , partially clad in an insect-like carapace. Its legs have two toes and a slightly darker circular coloration on the underside, and its tail has two barbs, giving its tail the resemblance of a vampire's fangs. Its arms are red with thin striations and are completely detached from its black wings, and each is ended with large pincers. Its ears have discernible, red, chambered ear insides, and its eyes are yellow. It has six visible fangs in its mouth, and its waist, like its arms, is red and striated. Gliscor's body resembles an open mouth, with the pointed protrusions coming from its upper torso resembling fangs, further illustrating its vampiric qualities. It has a tendency to hang upside down from trees while watching its prey.\nGliscor feeds on the blood of other Pok\u00e9mon species; grabbing prey using its tail, then biting their necks with its long, sharp fangs. It is even said to take pride once its prey is fully drained of blood. As shown in Riding the Winds of Change! , Gliscor, along with its unevolved form Gligar , can emit a sort of sound wave in order to detect obstacles and fly around them, similar to echolocation . Its legs appear to be not suitable for walking, so it can only perform short hops when on the ground. Gliscor hangs upside down while sleeping, much like other bat-like Pok\u00e9mon, and it is nocturnal. It is capable of soundless flight; however, its wings cannot be flapped to the same extent that other Pok\u00e9mon's wings can. Like Jumpluff and Wingull , Gliscor uses winds and updrafts to glide from place to place. When there is no wind, Gliscor climbs to the top of tall trees using its sharp raptorial claws and then glides from place to place. This practice is similar to flying squirrels. Gliscor is highly resistant against poisonous substances . It is extremely rare, but sometimes it is found in thick pine forests, swamps, and even alpine regions.",

Its brown fur is very thick to endure harsh cold and protect from snow and ice. Its tusks, which are smaller on a female Mamoswine than on a male, are made of pure, solid ice. Mamoswine has a blue mask-like pattern with a white rim around its face and eyes, resembling ski goggles. The fur on its muzzle is tan and shaggy, and its nose resembles that of a pig. Mamoswine's feet are black with three thick toes, and its tail is small.\nIt can endure harsh cold and hunger for an almost indefinite amount of time, as indicated by a ten-thousand-year-old specimen reviving. Mamoswine lived all around the world during the last ice age , but its population thinned when the climate grew warmer. Mamoswine inhabits cold places, such as mountainous regions and frozen tundra. Weavile is a natural predator of Mamoswine. Mamoswine is believed to have hidden potential that was awakened by the cold climate. In Kalos , there area called Route 17 / Mamoswine Road , where humans use rental Mamoswine to travel through the heavy snow in order to reach either Dendemille Town or Anistar City .",

Its head is fuchsia and ovoid in shape with a short, blunt antenna protruding upwards and a blue bill similar to that of a duck. Its eyes are yellow and have black rings, similar to a bulls-eye. The head is completely detached from the body and floats slightly above it. Its smooth, ovoid body is fuchsia with a blue ring connecting its arms. Two arms are loosely connected to their upper body and, other than their blue color, have no features. The tail is also blue and featureless but slightly resembles a paddle. Porygon-Z was given additional software in order to increase its abilities further, and its offensive power has greatly increased. The initial idea was to give Porygon2 the ability to travel through alien dimensions, but it did not work as planned. Instead, the resulting Pok\u00e9mon began showing highly erratic, unstable behavior and twitchy movements, making it difficult to work with for research. As a result, it is believed the experiment to create Porygon-Z was a failure. This has been attributed to the incompetence of the engineer improperly updating its programming. Academics can't seem to agree on whether Porygon-Z should be considered a true evolution of Porygon2. In ancient Hisui, people were confused about Porygon-Z and its evolutionary relatives due to them arriving through space-time distortions and being the product of far more advanced technology than what was available at the time. Porygon-Z and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Conversion and Conversion 2. Additionally, prior to Generation V and in Generation IX, Porygon-Z and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Download as an Ability.",

Its head resembles a gladiator's helmet with a white face, red eyes, and a teal head crest. It has spikes on the sides of its face.\nIt is a master of courtesy and swordsmanship capable of predicting its foe's moves, allowing it to strike preemptively. True to Gallade's honorable warrior image, it is just as protective of its Trainer as its counterpart, Gardevoir , using the blades on its elbows to defend. The shoulder blades are said to be sharper than even the best swords. Gallade is known to be sharply aware of a person's wish for help and seeks out those who need its assistance in battle, fighting savagely with fast and fierce attacks. It is capable of teaching itself swordsmanship at an impressive rate. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , Gallade can extend its blades at will to attack opponents from behind. This Pok\u00e9mon inhabits mountainous areas. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Gallade has been observed sleeping in a formal position with one knee up. It is believed that Gallade does this because, even in its sleep, it is preparing to fight and protect both humans and Pok\u00e9mon at any moment.",

It has a big red hat-like magnet on top of its head, and exudes strong magnetism from all over its body.\nBeing able to command these Mini-Noses, Probopass is able to catch prey and attack opponents from all three directions. On occasion, its Mini-Noses can get lost and may never come back. It emits strong magnetic fields that enable it to levitate, and can damage nearby appliances. Probopass can use the iron sand to form rocks, which it uses to destroy its prey. It is rarely seen in the wild, but may be found in mountainous regions very occasionally.",

            "description": "Dusknoir is a primarily black Pok\u00e9mon that somewhat resembles a cyclops. Its cylindrical head is light gray with a single eye that has a yellow iris and a red pupil. Its eyelid resembles a smiling mouth, with its red eye being a tongue. There is a yellow band near the top of its head, and a short, yellow antenna with a disc-shaped tip extends from on top. Six flat projections extend from the base of its neck and surround its head, resembling an upturned collar . Dusknoir has well-developed arms with two yellow bands near its wrists and large, gray hands. On the front of its torso are two almond-shaped markings, and on its back are two circular markings. Both sets of markings resemble eyes. A yellow band encircles its body, zigzagging along the front and forming a long curve around the back. It has a wispy tail in place of feet.\nThe antenna on Dusknoir's head allows it to receive transmissions from the spirit world , which tell it to bring people there. Dusknoir usually appears to those who are dead and bring their souls to the afterlife. Because of this, people highly fear Dusknoir. Sometimes, Dusknoir may accidentally take away the souls of those still alive, though this rarely happens. However, the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Diamond and Pearl episode Ghoul Daze! has shown it protecting innocent people from being taken to the spirit world. It is unknown if Dusknoir has a will of its own, or if it is forced to follow the bidding of the transmissions it receives. The band on its body can open, similar to a mouth. Dusknoir is capable of using its belly mouth to swallow its target whole. It also uses this ability to take spirits into its body and carry them home or as it travels to unknown places. Dusknoir only consumes spectral essence, leaving only the empty remains of living beings untouched.",

            "description": "Froslass is a humanoid Pok\u00e9mon with a hollow torso that resembles a kimono . It wears a red band around its waist, reminiscent of an Obi . Its body lacks feet and it floats in the air like its counterpart, Glalie . Its arms are connected to the sides of its head and flare at the wrists. The flared portion has a dappled light blue coloration. Its hands consist of three small fingers. Froslass's head is shaped similar to a sideways water droplet and is topped with two ice crystals that resemble horns. Its head has several holes on it, resembling a mask. Through two of these holes, crystal blue eyes with yellow sclerae can be seen. It also has a mouth below this \"mask\".\nFroslass lives in snowy areas and has the ability to freeze foes with its \u221258 degrees Fahrenheit breath. It is thought to display its victims secretly after freezing them. It enjoys preying on handsome men climbing in the mountains, but has also been known to take Pok\u00e9mon. Its favorite food is frozen souls. Froslass is known to bring its frozen prey back to the cave it lives in before lining them up neatly. It also goes down to human homes to knock on doors during nights of cold blizzards. There is a legend that Froslass will place curses on any men that misbehave. As evidenced in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Diamond and Pearl episode The Drifting Snorunt! , it can create illusions to manipulate others. Froslass is a female-only species and is said in legends to have been formed when the spirit and lingering regrets of a woman who was lost in the mountains possessed an icicle.",

It has a chest plate on its torso, which has a deep blue diamond-like crystal embedded in the center. Dialga has a fin-like structure on its back, three spines on the back of its neck, and a crest on its head, resembling a dinosaur. The crest somewhat resembles the shape of a sundial's rod. It also has two structures on the sides of its head that extend outward and resemble horns and fangs. It has three claws on each foot, of the same metallic look as its chest plate. The spikes on Dialga's back, at a certain point of view, look similar to a Time Gear .\nDialga has the power to control time; it can warp time by either speeding it up, slowing it down, reversing it, or stopping it altogether. It can also travel through time to visit the past, present, and future. Additionally, it is capable of blasting its targets with power that distorts time itself . It also has the power to destroy and create an entire universe, either by itself or with Palkia's aid. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series , Dialga's temporal powers possess the ability to devolve anything or anyone against their will, including Pok\u00e9mon , people , and plant life . It can reverse these effects as well. It is said that time started moving when Dialga was born and will continue flowing as long as its heart beats. Dialga usually travels by levitating. Since Dialga primarily resides in a different dimension, its behavior is nearly impossible to study. In the dimension where Dialga lives in, time is said to be constantly moving in different directions and speeds. It has been shown to be very protective of its home. It also tends to have violent conflicts with its counterpart Palkia. The fin-like structure on its back is shaped radiating outwards and can be used to focus the flow of time, as seen in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon .\nAccording to the myths and legends of the Hisui / Sinnoh region , in the beginning of time, the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Arceus created the Pok\u00e9mon of time\u2013Dialga, the Pok\u00e9mon of space\u2013 Palkia , and the Pok\u00e9mon of antimatter\u2013 Giratina , all three in their Origin Formes . After the Pok\u00e9mon universe was created, Dialga retreated into its own dimension , where it has lived since. It was revered and feared as a deity in the past, being worshipped by the Diamond Clan , who referred to it as \" almighty Sinnoh \". Dialga is capable of speaking human language via telepathy, as seen when it communicates through the leader of the Diamond Clan, Adaman . Dialga and Palkia can control and spread the space-time distortions caused by Giratina , which create alpha Pok\u00e9mon and cause noble Pok\u00e9mon to become frenzied through lightning bolts that come out of the distortions.\nDialga is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Roar of Time .",

It has round purple-striped plates on its shoulder area, where two pink pearl-like crystals lie encrusted with a gray rim encircling them, and fin-like wings on its back. Palkia's arms have extended formations resembling gauntlets and a purple band around each wrist. Palkia has a long neck that is normally bent, a pointed white crest on the top of its head that extends to its wings, two strong horn-like tusks on the sides of its jaw, and a powerful tail. It has faint cracks along its legs and tail.\nPalkia has power over space: it can warp space and travel to faraway places as well as alternate dimensions and parallel timelines . Additionally, it is capable of rending its targets along with the space around it . It even has the power to destroy and create an entire universe , either by itself or with Dialga 's aid. As seen in Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series , Palkia can open and close dimensional portals to alternate universes. It is said that the birth of Palkia was what caused the walls of the world to disappear, creating a sky that spans for infinity. It is also said that space becomes more stable with its every breath. Palkia usually travels by levitating.\nSince Palkia primarily resides in a different dimension, its behavior is nearly impossible to study. The dimension Palkia lives in is said to be in shreds like ribbons. Palkia is known to be very protective of its home. It has been seen in violent conflicts with its counterpart Dialga. As seen in Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon , Palkia is capable of travelling by creating a large yellow sphere from its two pearls, then using it to fly very fast.\nAccording to the myths and legends of the Hisui / Sinnoh region , in the beginning of time, the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Arceus created the Pok\u00e9mon of space\u2013Palkia, the Pok\u00e9mon of time\u2013 Dialga , and the Pok\u00e9mon of antimatter\u2013 Giratina , all three in their Origin Formes . After the Pok\u00e9mon universe was created, Palkia retreated into its own dimension , where it has lived ever since. It was revered and feared as a deity in the past, being worshipped by the Pearl Clan , who referred to it as \" almighty Sinnoh \". Palkia is capable of speaking human language via telepathy, as seen when it communicates through the leader of the Pearl Clan, Irida . Palkia and Dialga can control and spread the space-time distortions caused by Giratina , which create alpha Pok\u00e9mon and cause noble Pok\u00e9mon to become frenzied through lightning bolts that come out of the distortions.\nPalkia is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Spacial Rend .",

Its eyes seem to remain open even when it is asleep. Whenever it is seen with its mouth open, an orange glow emanates from inside it. Boiling magma-like blood circulates through its body. While its body is rugged steel, certain parts of it are partially melted, due to Heatran's own intense body heat.\nHeatran is a fierce guardian.

Heatran's claws allow it to dig deep into walls, and its feet allow it to stick to a surface, so it can hang and climb from walls and ceilings.

This section contains seven black circular \"eyes\" arranged in a specific pattern. The pattern is Regigigas's way of showing its anger; its eyes glow red when it is provoked. It has six spots that are apart from its eyes, which appear to be gemstones. These gemstones seem to represent the original three legendary giants , with red gems representing Regirock , blue gems indicating Regice , and silver gems representing Registeel . Regigigas has long arms, with three fairly human-like white fingers, and short legs. Its body is covered in black stripes, and it has large bushes of moss growing in its back and feet.\nRegigigas is a skilled craftsman. It created golems out of inanimate objects and elemental energies in its image, bringing them to life. Regigigas is also capable of controlling these legendary giants, even if they already belong to a different Trainer . It can also survive extreme conditions as it is able to work with the boiling temperatures of magma as well as frigid ice (\u2212328\u00a0\u00b0F / \u2212200\u00a0\u00b0C). When Regigigas is disturbed from its slumber, it goes on a rampage and shoots powerful beams of energy. When it is befriended, however, it is calm and gentle, as seen in Pillars of Friendship! . According to Sinnoh legend, Regigigas's strength enables it to move continents. Regigigas can be summoned or awakened by the legendary giants.\nRegigigas is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Crush Grip .

            "description": "Giratina is a large gray draconic Pok\u00e9mon with three gold half-rings on each side of its long neck. Its head has a gold crown-like object surrounding it with two large horns pointing sideways. A thick black stripe runs vertically along its front with five red horizontal stripes. In its Altered Forme, it has two large black ghostly wings with three red tips on each that can resemble claws. These wings can change shape as if made of a liquid or gas. Its six legs are thick and have golden claws. Two golden half-circles similar to those on its neck are on each side of each leg, resembling shackles. It has a tail with two band-like markings. Giratina remains in its Altered Forme when outside of its home dimension. It generally moves by levitating itself in the air, as opposed to walking on its six legs. According to the myths and legends of the Hisui/Sinnoh region, in the beginning of time, the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Arceus created the Pok\u00e9mon of antimatter\u2013Giratina, the Pok\u00e9mon of time\u2013Dialga, and the Pok\u00e9mon of space\u2013Palkia, all three in their Origin Formes. After the Pok\u00e9mon universe was created, due to Giratina's violent nature, Arceus banished it to a world on the reverse side of the Pok\u00e9mon world, the Distortion World. Giratina is a highly aggressive and territorial Pok\u00e9mon that is protective of its home. It has also been reported to appear in ancient cemeteries. As seen in Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus, Giratina has the power to tear a hole in reality, creating a space-time rift along with driving both Dialga and Palkia berserk. The rift also causes huge lightnings that drive noble Pok\u00e9mon into a frenzied state. It is also capable of cloaking itself in darkness as it attacks. Giratina is said to be equal in strength to Dialga and Palkia. Giratina at one point carried a large grudge against its creator Arceus and was willing to stand against it with the help of a human named Volo, but after being beaten by a human from another time and fleeing, it would start to change its ways and protect the universe from threats such as Cyrus. Due to its typically violent nature, the history of Giratina was covered up due to ancient people fearing it. Giratina is said to have observed the real world silently while in its home dimension. As depicted in Giratina and the Sky Warrior, Giratina can also open portals through any reflective surface. Giratina's role is to keep both worlds in balance. Giratina also had many different titles, the banished Pok\u00e9mon, Arceus's shadow, the Pok\u00e9mon of Shadows, and the being on the other side of our world. Giratina is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Shadow Force by leveling up, which gives it the ability to temporarily turn invisible. Giratina can change between its Altered Forme and Origin Forme. Compared to Palkia and Dialga, both of which resemble Arceus in their Origin Formes, Giratina's Origin Forme takes on a serpentine look. Its legs are reduced to golden-tipped spikes, and four additional golden spikes appear near the edge of its tail. While in Origin Forme, the six gold half-rings can grip objects. The back points of each half-ring have a black ghostly tendril with a red spike at its tip. The horns on its head are now facing the back. The sides of the golden 'crown' cover its mouth and separate vertically like an insect's mandible when it opens its mouth. The black vertical stripe is broken into pieces and runs down its body. The Origin Forme of Giratina is said to be Giratina's true form, capable of traveling through and controlling dimensions besides those of time and space. Giratina can only be in its Origin Forme when in its home, the Distortion World, or when holding either a Griseous Orb or Griseous Core. Giratina can also maintain its Origin Forme in the real world without items should it get a sufficient amount of power, enough to potentially be equal to Arceus. Giratina is at its full power when in the Origin Forme, and is always levitated in this state. When in its Origin Forme, it can pass through dimensions at will, although it will turn back to its Altered Forme due to the gravity change from the Distortion World. Giratina has the power to turn itself into a shadow and to merge the Distortion World with the Pok\u00e9mon world, as seen during the events of Spear Pillar. However, this has the dangerous side effect of distorting it to the risk of being destroyed.",

            "description": "Cresselia is a Pok\u00e9mon that has a blue, swan-like body with a yellow underside. It has pink eyes, a dark pink, round tuft on its head, and a pointed, beak-like snout. There are yellow, crescent-shaped ornaments on the sides of its head that merge in the back. It has a pointed, tail-like protrusion on its rear. Cresselia has glowing, pink, ring-like wings on its sides and back. The wings on its sides are solid dark pink, while the wing on its back is larger and consists of three shades of pink. These wings, especially its back wing, release shining particles and undulate beautifully around the quarter moon. It has paw-like protrusions resting on its chest. Cresselia generally floats in the air, but may rest on the floor when it is injured.\nDue to its appearance, Cresselia is said to resemble a crescent moon and the woman who made the Milky Way. Cresselia has the power to dispel nightmares, and holding one of its feathers is said to bring happy dreams. It is also great at recovery and healing techniques. Cresselia can unleash spores in the air to cause confusion on opponents while forming a shield to defend itself at the same time. Its relationship to its counterpart, Darkrai , can vary between individuals and canons , with some being antagonistic, as seen in Sleepless In Pre-Battle! and Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time, Darkness , and Sky , or cooperative, as seen in Nightfall? Nightmares! and A Midsummer Night's Light! . It tends to reside on an island or mountain that has a Darkrai nearby in order to keep an eye on it. Cresselia is a female-only species.\nCresselia is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Lunar Dance and Lunar Blessing .",

Its mouth is small, and its eyes are large with blue sclerae and gray irises. Above its eyes are two blue, circular markings connected to the eyes by a thin black line. Its long, flipper-like arms have rounded tips. Phione has a red, oval gem on its chest and a single rudimentary foot spike.\nPhione inflates the sac on its head to drift in the water and search for food. When the water grows warm, it will drift in packs with other members of its species. No matter how far it has drifted, it will always return to the place where it was born. Sometimes it will be seen with Manaphy, visiting the Hisui region on rare occasions. Against natural predators, it uses a defense mechanism that allows it to blend with ocean waters. Phione are known to hatch from eggs laid by Manaphy, although the relationship between the two species is still unknown.\nPhione and its counterpart Manaphy are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Take Heart .",

It has a small head with a white fog-like ghostly plume billowing from its head covering one of its bright blue eyes, with the portion on its face resembling hair. It also has a red spiky growth around its neck. It has skinny arms and long black tatters hanging from its shoulders. It also has black, claw-like hands. It has the slight appearance of an hourglass figure and appears to be wearing an old, ripped cloak. It normally does not have any sort of legs, but it is able to extend stilt-like appendages in their place. In self-defense, Darkrai can retract its head and white \"plume\" into the pit atop its torso fringed by the aforementioned red growth.\nDarkrai is known to \"inhabit\" dreams and causes the target to have unending nightmares, which can be stopped if exposed to a Lunar Feather from Cresselia . However, the \"unleashing of nightmares\" is actually a defense mechanism, instead of an intentionally malicious act. Darkrai is capable of flying at high speeds, and it can become a shadow in order to escape danger or contact with humans. It is also capable of some human speech. In The Rise of Darkrai , it was shown its power was weaker than that of Dialga and Palkia . Its relationship to its counterpart, Cresselia, can vary between individuals and canons , with some being antagonistic, as seen Sleepless In Pre-Battle! and Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time, Darkness , and Sky , or cooperative, as seen in Nightfall? Nightmares! and A Midsummer Night's Light! . As seen in Sleepless In Pre-Battle! , Darkrai does not only cause nightmares; it is also attracted to them. It can also go around objects it is attracted to several times, as seen in the mentioned episode and Pok\u00e9mon Ranger: Shadows of Almia . Shadows of Almia also reveal Darkrai can use an ability called Dark Powe r to either trap humans or Pok\u00e9mon in a Dark Void dimension of total darkness or teleport them to another location. Darkrai is said to be active on nights of the new moon. Darkrai possibly feeds off dreams, characterized by its association with never-ending nightmares.\nDarkrai is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Dark Void . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Bad Dreams as an Ability .",

            "description": "Shaymin is a small, white, hedgehog-like Pok\u00e9mon. In Land Forme, it has green grass-like fur on its back and a pink flower with two leaves on each side of its head, which resembles the Gracidea flower. More flowers appear on its back whenever it feels comfortable, but when it senses danger, it rapidly hides them again. Its legs are short and its underside is plump. Shaymin is one of the shortest Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon. Shaymin can instantly purify any polluted area of all impurities in the air and transform it into a lush field of flowers. It takes in the polluted air, purifies it inside its body, breaks it down into water and light, and releases the purified substance in a violent, explosive burst. Its power varies based on the type of pollution absorbed. Shaymin can also communicate with telepathy and sense the gratitude of others. Each season, Shaymin gathers with others in a flower field somewhere and migrates from there. This behavior is called Flower Carrying, because a new field of flowers grow wherever it lands. Shaymin is also attracted to areas where there is a lot of gratitude. Land Forme Shaymin has a shy personality and is easily scared. If wet, it shakes itself dry. It also exhibits the behavior of scratching itself with its hind leg. Shaymin lives in fields of flowers. Since it camouflages by curling itself up, it can easily escape people's notice. It has been observed to like sweet food.",

            "description": "Arceus is a white, equine Pok\u00e9mon with an androgynous appearance. It resembles a qilin or centaur with a gray, vertically striated underside. The striated pattern also appears on the underside of its mane, tail, and face. Its four pointed feet are tipped with gold hooves. Its long mane juts away from its head, and its face is gray, with green eyes, red pupils, and a green circular pattern below its eyes. Arceus also has a streak of gold coloration on its head and ears, which point upward. Its neck is fairly long, with two pairs of extrusions to the sides, and a flap-like feature on the neck's underside that is colored white like much of the body. Arceus also has a golden cross-like wheel attached to its body by its round abdomen, which changes color along with its eyes and hooves based on its current type , depending on the Plate or type-specific Z-Crystal that it wields. The wheel also has four jewels attached to it. The pattern of striated gray of Arceus's underbelly continues past its waist. Its limbs have gray undersides and extrusions at the tops of the legs. Arceus's tail is similar to its mane in terms of shape and coloration. Despite its quadruped appearance, Arceus is capable of flight.\nAccording to legend, it shaped the Pok\u00e9mon universe using its 1,000 arms. Arceus has been referred to as \" The Original One \" in myths and legends and is generally considered one of the strongest Pok\u00e9mon. Arceus is believed to be the creator of the Sinnoh / Hisui and Ransei regions and possibly the entire Pok\u00e9mon universe, along with the lake guardians : Uxie , Azelf , and Mesprit , as well as the Pok\u00e9mon of Myth : Dialga , Palkia , and Giratina . Because of this, Arceus is thought to be one of the longest-lived Pok\u00e9mon species. It has the power to recreate the Pok\u00e9mon of Myth as well, presumably to guard the dimensions when a Trainer has caught one of them. In Arceus and the Jewel of Life , Arceus is portrayed as having powers such as bringing back things that it once destroyed, making certain things vanish into thin air, halting time, and overturning the very laws of nature. In the same movie, it is said to \"feed\" off the energy of its Plates.\nArceus does not suffer fools gladly and will attack in a violent rampage if betrayed or deceived. It also holds long grudges if betrayed by those it considered friends. In Hoopa and the Clash of Ages , it was shown to be able to stop the destruction caused by a space-time void. As shown in the Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series episode Showdown at the Gates of Warp! , Arceus has the power to not only calm Dialga and Palkia, but also destroy the Red Chain controlling them. It can release countless shots of light that disintegrate the landscape around it. Arceus can change its type at will to adapt to a situation through the use of its Plates or type-specific Z-Crystals . Arceus also has the power to split in two, creating a piece of itself to exist outside of its realm, which is implied to be its physical form\u2014only a piece of its whole being\u2014while its true form is unknown and incomprehensible.\nArceus was known to care for and safeguard the planet in ancient times, protecting the world from cataclysms such as meteors, and it would show gratitude and compassion to those who treated it with kindness. In modern times, Arceus continues to watch over the world and wishes for people and Pok\u00e9mon to work together in the face of adversity. Even when it is needed, it only give on how to solve problems instead of directly interfering. Arceus can also give its blessing to other Pok\u00e9mon through bolts of light, making them bigger and more powerful, as seen with the ancient hero 's 10 Pok\u00e9mon companions. This blessing is also passed down through family lines, as seen with the descendants of the hero's Pok\u00e9mon: the noble Pok\u00e9mon and ride Pok\u00e9mon worshipped by the people of Hisui .\nIn Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus , Arceus transformed a normal cellphone into an Arc Phone , a device that allows humans to communicate with it through text messages. Arceus also has the power to appear in dreams and create a variety of Pok\u00e9mon to serve as challenges, as seen in Eternal Battle Reverie . In Pok\u00e9mon Masters EX , through the sync stones ultimate , Arceus can give its blessing to a Trainer it deems worthy, transforming their outfits into costumes known as arc suits . As a result, their sync pair is blessed as well, granting them a divine move over their normal sync move . In Arceus and the Jewel of Life , using its Earth , Splash , Meadow , Zap , and Draco Plates , Arceus created the Jewel of Life , a powerful artifact capable of turning a desolate land into a rich and fertile one.\nAs seen in the introduction sequence of Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus , Arceus resides in a realm beyond time and space . There, it appears as a large ammount of golden light shaped like the silhouette of its normal appearance. This is supposedly its true form. It was also shown to be capable of human speech , stating that \"Arceus\" is simply the name humans call it. The first ancient inhabitants of the Hisui region , the Celestica people , worshipped it, referring to it as \" almighty Sinnoh \" and \" great Sinnoh \". Arceus also held the title \" might of Sinnoh \", with the term \"Sinnoh\" later on becoming the name of the region . The Diamond Clan and Pearl Clan also worship it, though they mistook Dialga and Palkia respectively for Arceus. In ancient myths, it is said that the Origin Ore , an ore of mysterious power, contains the power of Arceus itself. In Alola , Arceus was used as base by the Aether Foundation to create an artificial Pok\u00e9mon named Type: Full as part of the Beast killer project , with an Ability similar to Arceus's. However, the project was deemed a failure and was later abandoned, sealing Type: Full's ability with a control helmet, which caused it to devolve and be renamed as Type: Null .\nArceus is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Judgment . It is also able to use charged-up versions of the Pok\u00e9mon of Myth 's signature moves: Roar of Time , Spacial Rend and Shadow Force , as seen in its boss battle in Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus. Additionally, Arceus is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Multitype as an Ability .",

Its bulbous arms and legs are rounded to make a sort of \"cuff\" before ending with small, three-fingered hands and two-toed feet. It has two pointed teeth that can be seen on its upper jaw. It also has two cream winglike tails, which allows it to fly. Though timid, it is a caring Pok\u00e9mon; it will fight if its friends are in danger.\nVictini is said to bring victory to the Trainer that befriends it. It produces an infinite amount of energy within itself and can share it with others by touch. It can also become invisible.

However, the tail will begin to droop when Snivy loses energy. Snivy can use its vines with incredible adaptive and dexterity skills, to make up for having short arms. This Pok\u00e9mon has a calm, collected demeanor and is very intelligent. Snivy prefers to be alone and avoid groups whenever it can.

It has a yellow V-shaped structure that starts at the chest and extends behind the shoulders. Servine has short limbs and a small crest protruding from the back of its head. Three palmate leaves grow along its back and tail.\nThese leaves are capable of performing photosynthesis, but only while they are clean. Servine will go to great lengths to stay dirt-free for this reason. This swift Pok\u00e9mon hides in thick foliage or shadows to avoid attacks before retaliating. Servine will mercilessly pummel its target by whipping them with its vines. Servine has an inflated sense of pride, which is one of Servine's weaknesses. Due to this pride, Servine will be unable to cooperate with other Pok\u00e9mon for a long while.",

Curled, mint-colored patterns extend into the white portion of its face, and it has narrow red eyes. In the lower jaw, two fangs are visible when its mouth is open. There are two pointed yellow extensions on the back of its head. Coiled, dark green extensions spread out from the sides of its lower neck, forming a curving pattern lower down the body. It has now completely lost the legs from its previous stages and now must slither about due to its new, serpentine form; however, just below its neck, it has two small leaf-like arms on either side of its body, which it usually keeps folded behind its back. It has curved yellow markings around its middle and several palmate leaves on its tail.\nSerperior will only attack with full force against opponents that are unfazed by its piercing glare, which is said to be able to halt its foes' movements. This intimidating stare and its regal form have earned it the title of \"Lord of the Forest\". It is capable of amplifying solar energy with its body.",

Tepig can use its speed to both dodge and confound enemies before striking back. Instead of flames, it will spout thick, black smoke when ill. Tepig is a well-known ravenous glutton for food. Tepig will roast berries before eating them but occasionally gets overexcited and burns them.

Its chubby body is orange with brown bands around its shoulders, sides, belly, hands, and from the back of its head down its snout. Yellow bands encircle its wrists and swirled yellow designs bulge from its chest. It has a red pig-like nose, pointed ears, and two pointed teeth that protrude from its lower jaw. Its hands have two claws each, while its feet have only a single nail. Its tail is curled with a tuft of fur at the tip.\nPignite is willing to defend its friends from opponents, no matter how strong they are. It has a fire in its stomach, which it fuels with food. This fire can affect its body temperature. The intensity of this flame increases as fuel is added or when Pignite is angered. As the flame grows stronger, Pignite's speed increases. On occasion, Pignite's body temperature will go so high that it becomes engulfed by a scorching fireball. However, it has no strength remaining whenever it has an empty stomach. If in danger, it will blow out large smoke clouds to escape.\nPrior to Generation VIII , Pignite and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Heat Crash .",

Its arms have orange upper portions while the legs have red upper portions. All of its limbs have black lower portions with thin yellow lines where the upper and lower colors meet. These lines are straight on the arms and spiked on the legs. The arms have red lines around the wrists and tufts of fur on the elbows. The hands are tipped with three claws, while the feet have two claws. A large, dark horizontal stripe on the chest of Emboar has swirled yellow markings. Its small tail ends in a tuft of hair.\nUsing the wreath of flames on its neck and shoulders, Emboar will set its hands on fire. It uses its power and speed to master fighting moves. This power can be increased when Emboar's neck flame intensifies. The more dire the situation is, the more excited Emboar becomes to the point of enjoying itself. Though very tough and relentless when fighting, it shows deep affection for those it considers friends. It can also unleash powerful blasts of fire using only its nose and cloak its body in a fire to use many powerful attacks.\nPrior to Generation VIII , Emboar and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Heat Crash .",

Its arms are white and rounded, while its feet are dark blue with three toes each. It also possesses a rudder-like dark blue tail. It carries a pale yellow seashell called a \" scalchop \" on its belly.\nThis shell is made of the same material as its claws and is used for both battles and cracking hard berries . Oshawott wields the shell like a knife. It uses the scalchop to block the moves of its enemies before slashing back at them in swift retaliation. Oshawott learned to how maintain its scalchop with riverbed stones by copying the humans it observes using whetstones. If the scalchop is heavily damaged or lost, Oshawott can grow a new one from its navel. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy .",

Its forelimbs have three fingers on each black paw. Its feet and flat tail are black. Around its waist is a large, dark blue, fringed arrangement of fur, with two scalchops on the thighs.\nDewott is known to have a studious and stern nature. Dewott's scalchops are detachable, and Dewott regularly trains to use techniques with them; these techniques differ between individual Dewott. It maintains this technique through dedicated and repeated training. It always maintains its scalchops as well. Its flowing double-scalchop techniques can defeat even those who master the art of swordsmanship. Humans have modeled their swordplay by observing Dewott\u2019s movements on how it flows like water and wielding its two scalchops. When exposed to the harsh environment of Hisui , Dewott gains an additional Dark-type when it evolves into Hisuian Samurott .",

It has pointed canine teeth, and a red nose, and its eyes have white sclera and circular red irises. Long white whiskers resembling mustaches extend from its snout and lower jaw. Samurott possesses three black claws on each limb, and a fin-like tail resembling a war fan. Samurott's head, limbs, and tail are adorned with cream-colored armor resembling seashells. The armor on its head resembles a spiked conch shell. This helmet-like armor is bulbous in the back, and tapers into a spear-like horn in the front. Segmented armor resembling bracers covers each of Samurott's limbs. The forelimbs' bracers contain shell swords called seamitars . The two lower segments of these bracers serve as scabbards for these seamitars, and the upper segment and spike are the seamitars' blade and handle, respectively.\nIn battle, Samurott can stand on its hind limbs and use its seamitars to fight. In the time it takes a foe to blink, Samurott can draw, attack with, and sheathe the seamitars attached to its front legs. It is said that Samurott can fell an opponent in one swing, and that it can silence foes with a glare or a howl. Samurott is a master of a sword-drawing art called the iaijutsu . Samurott leads its group with strict leadership. Samurott will mercilessly thrash those who do not follow its rules with the group.",

This facial fur can be used for radar and provides Lillipup with information about its surroundings. It has large pointed ears with a tuft of fur near the base of each. Its fur puffs out above its paws, and its back has a spiky dark blue blaze. Each paw has three toes, and a blue paw pad that can be seen in Pok\u00e9dex 3D Pro . It has a short, tufty tail.\nIt is an intelligent, courageous Pok\u00e9mon capable of judging its opponent's strength. Lillipup's intelligence and obedience makes it popular for beginners due to how easy it is to raise. It is also extremely popular with Trainers living in apartments due to it never yelping. It uses its fur as a radar for checking the opponents' condition. While normally it is very brave, Lillipup is cautious to know when to flee from an opponent it cannot defeat. Due to it being smarter than the average child, Lillipup never forgets the love or abuse it receives while being raised.",

It has four short legs, with three-toed paws. Each paw has a dark blue paw pad that can be seen in Pok\u00e9dex 3D Pro .\nHerdier is very loyal, smart, friendly, and it will help its Trainer raise other Pok\u00e9mon. However, it will not obey anyone who disrespects it. It has helped Trainers since long ago. Herdier has been theorized to have been the first Pok\u00e9mon to have been partnered with humans based on what was discovered on the walls of caves. Its dense fur continues to grow endlessly. As Herdier's fur grows, it becomes more springily and impervious. Any claws or fang attempting to penetrate its fur would just bounce off. However, the fur makes Herdier difficult to train due to how much it costs to groom its dense fur.",

It has tufty, pointed ears with dark blue insides, a black nose surrounded by short black whiskers, and small eyes that are nearly hidden behind its facial fur. Its body is covered with shaggy fur that is dark blue along the back and grayish-blue toward the legs. Its face and paws are light brown, and each paw has three toes with white claws. Blue paw pads can also be seen on each paw in Pok\u00e9dex 3D Pro .\nStoutland has an intelligent, good-natured, valiant, and trustworthy disposition, being a partner of choice for many. Its fur is thick enough to protect itself and others against freezing temperatures. Due to this, every household in cold regions kept a Stoutland for warmth in the past. Stoutland is known to rescue humans that are either stranded in the mountains or at sea. Stoutland found in Alola look fairly uncomfortable, however. In Alola, Stoutland is used as a Ride Pok\u00e9mon called Stoutland Search to locate hidden items. Stoutland can do this thanks to its strong nose. Stoutland enjoys spending time with humans and can warm up to them in just three days. Stoutland has been used by parents as babysitters to watch their children. It is known to be very proud of its impressive mustache, the reason being due to its length determining Stoutland's social status among its species.",

It has a long, curving tail with a sickle-like shape toward the tip.\nLiepard has well-developed muscles that allows it to run silently and strike opponents from behind. It has also been known to vanish and reappear without warning. It is known to be rather moody and vicious. In Galar , it competes with Thievul for territory.",

Its hands have five fingers, and its feet have three toes. Meanwhile, its arms, legs, and lower belly, along with the rest of its head, hands, and feet, are all red. Its upper and lower belly are separated in color at the midsection by a red spike pattern extending upward from its legs. It has large oval eyes and a small black nose, and its ears are broad with orange insides. On its head is a swirled, flame-like red tuft with a smaller tuft on either side; its fluffy, swirled tail resembles a flame as well. Simisear has white, fluffy shoulder ruffs that resemble smoke.\nSimisear loves sweet foods and consumes them to fuel the flame burning inside its body. When it becomes excited, its body becomes hot, and embers rise from its tail and head tuft. It is also capable of scattering embers from these areas to attack opponents.",

A person whose dream was eaten by a Munna will forget the dream's contents. The Dream Mist will be pink if the dream was pleasant. Munna can also seek out and cure people and Pok\u00e9mon who are having nightmares by eating their dreams; the Dream Mist extracted from a nightmare will be black in color.

            "description": "Musharna is a rounded, bipedal Pok\u00e9mon that has a tapir-like trunk. Its body is light purple, while its head is a pale pink. It has oval, red eyes with three eyelashes and dark pink ovals on its forehead and cheeks. Its eyes are normally closed, but open when Musharna falls asleep. The tips of its four stubby limbs are dark pink. Dream Mist seeps out of the mark on its forehead.\nLike its pre-evolution Munna, Musharna eats the dreams of people and Pok\u00e9mon. Musharna's Dream Mist has various colors depending on what kind of dreams it has eaten; it is most often pink in color. Shapes and forms of the dreams Musharna has eaten can appear in the mist as well. It is advised not to approach Musharna when its Dream Mist is dark in color, as the dark mist brings a person's nightmares to life. Musharna sleeps and dreams constantly. It can become a terrible grump should it be freshly roused from sleep. Musharna and its pre-evolution are thought to share common ancestry with Drowzee .",

It has a short, black beak with a bulbous pink cere , and a black patch on the nape of its neck. There is a wide, heart-shaped area of lighter coloration on its chest. Pidove's black wings have a thick gray stripe down the side. It has pink feet with black talons.\nPidove is not particularly intelligent. While it always listens to its Trainer's commands, it does not always understand them. Pidove are so forgetful that they will wait for new orders from their Trainers even if it received one right before. In Detective Pikachu , their forgetfulness extends to them not even remembering their own names. In the Template:Aniseres episode There's a New Kid in Town! , it extends to forgetting whatever scared them. Many Trainers love Pidove due to its friendliness and sincere nature. Pidove loves to follow people. Having no fear of people, flocks of Pidove are often found in city parks and plazas, though they can also be seen in grasslands and rural areas. The cooing of these flocks can be very noisy. About several hundred Pidove are known to gather when food is scattered on the ground for them.",

Its beak and eyes are yellow, and it has light gray legs with three clawed toes and a spur on the ankle.\nThe male Unfezant has a reddish-pink wattle around its eyes. Long, ribbon-like growths from the wattle extend over its head and down past its shoulders. By swinging its head, the male threatens its opponents. The male also has a mint green underside with speckling towards the chest. The males are known to fly faster than the females. In contrast, the female lacks a wattle and has brown markings on its underside. It is also more adept at flying than the males due to its stamina. However, the females take a longer time to adjust to people.\nUnfezant are known to be immensely proud and intelligent. It prefers to not feel close to anyone other than its Trainer .",

It has a rounded muzzle with a large, dark nose and oval, blue eyes with yellow sclerae. On top of its head are short, triangular ears with blue insides. Below the knees, its legs are white with black hooves. Its tail is stubby, white, and has two points. Running up its neck is a spiky, white mane, which culminates at the front in a long extension that resembles a lightning bolt.\nThis mane captures and stores electricity, which flashes whenever this Pok\u00e9mon discharges electricity from it. It communicates with other members of its species by controlling the rhythm and frequency of these flashes. Blitzle generates electricity with its heartbeat. Whenever Blitzle is startled, its heart rate goes up, and the voltage of its electricity rises with it. During lightning storms, Blitzle ventures out to recharge its mane with lightning bolts. For this reason, Blitzle tends to live in places with lots of lightning strikes. Blitzle lives in herds run by Zebstrika .",

Its ears are triangular with blue insides, while its eyes are blue with yellow sclerae and white eyelashes. Its nose is black, and its hooves are gray. A white, spiked mane runs the length of its body, beginning with two horn-like extensions on its forehead and running down its back to end in a long tail with a starburst-shaped tip.\nZebstrika has an aggressive and volatile personality. This irritable Pok\u00e9mon fires lightning bolts from its mane when angry. The sign of that is when its white mane illuminates in a yellow glow. Zebstrika can move as quickly as lightning, releasing thunderclaps at full gallop. Zebstrika is known to lead Blitzle herds into thunderstorms. The main reason is to use the lightning unleashed by the storm to charge up Zebstrika's herd.",

It has a hexagonal, yellow artifice in the center of its body, leading to a hexagonal opening that functions as an ear. Roggenrola has a brown, rocky oblong atop its head and similar brown rocks that serve as feet.\nRoggenrola is born deep underground and was discovered about 100 years ago in an earthquake fissure in a layer of exposed rock. Its steel-hard body is made up of dirt from many centuries ago and it compares its hard body with those of Geodude and Carbink ; however, a sufficiently long soak in water will cause its body to soften to some degree. Inside of Roggenrola lies an energy core, making its body somewhat warm to the touch. Its ear leads straight to its energy core, causing it to become angry if someone sticks their hand in there. As stated by Cilan in Where Did You Go, Audino? , Roggenrola has sensitive hearing and can hear sounds that are inaudible to humans. It tends to follow the sounds it picks up with its lone ear, panicking if these sounds cease. Dwebble is a natural enemy of Roggenrola, as the former tends to think that Roggenrola is an inanimate rock to turn into a home. Sometimes, Rhyperior mistakes this Pok\u00e9mon for an ordinary rock and fires them through their hands.",

            "description": "Boldore is a blue, rock-like Pok\u00e9mon with an array of red crystals on its back and front, and a spine protruding from between its yellow ears. Rocky chunks at its sides comprise pincer-like limbs, tipped with red crystals similar to the ones on its back. Its orange crystals, which are tough enough to break diamonds, are the hardened form of its endlessly leaking energy.\nBoldore's crystals shine brightly when it begins overflowing with power or when it is preparing to fire bursts of energy. Because its crystals are valuable, with a fragment being capable of powering a hundred dump trucks, Boldore is targeted for them. It searches for underground water in the caves where it lives; however, because it is uncomfortable around water, it is always very careful about lapping it up. A healthy Boldore will always have its core sticking out. Due to relying on sound to know what is nearby, it always faces the same way, never moving in a diagonal direction; even when brought to anger, it will attack while facing in its initial direction.",

Each foot also bears two claws of a similar appearance and is connected to the body by gray joints. The yellow, front-facing ears of its previous evolutionary relatives are now filled in with red and appear to have become full-fledged eyes. Several of the aforementioned red crystals also appear on its face; three below its eyes, one in the middle resembling a crest, and two other crystals connected to the sides of its head.\nGigalith compresses energy in the core inside its body, allowing it to fire attacks powerful enough to blow away mountains. When it fires these attacks at full power, the sheer force of the blast creates multiple cracks on its body. It can also store sunlight in its orange crystals, magnify it within its body, and shoot powerful energy balls that can destroy dump trucks from its mouth, though it loses this ability at night or during rain. It lives in caves and tunnels deep underground. Gigalith is a hardy Pok\u00e9mon with hefty horsepower and is a popular partner for construction workers and miners. In Galar , it works with Copperajah in construction sites and mines.",

            "description": "Drilbur is a mole-like Pok\u00e9mon that has a short, wide body with two small, ovoid feet with three toes each. Its body is mostly black, but has a jagged, navy blue stripe that runs diagonally around its torso from its left shoulder. It is connected at the bottom to another stripe, which extends around the base of its torso. It has a white face with a long snout, tipped by its pink nose. Its eyes are at the base of its nose on either side. Drilbur's arms are wide and thin with a blue spot on its palms. It lacks traditional hands, as its arms form directly into its three, extremely large claws. It has a very small, stubby tail.\nDrilbur can straighten its body and align its claws forward, allowing it to spin like a drill and dig through the ground. It can dig at speeds of up to 30\u00a0mph (50\u00a0km/h). A Drilbur is fast enough to make a running car race with it. As seen in the 481st chapter of Pok\u00e9mon Adventures and the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Black & White episode A Village Homecoming! , Drilbur has no issues being around humans and can be very friendly. However, many farmers dislike Drilbur because it tends to destroy their vegetable crops.",

Three markings are on its front, resembling scratch marks, with two under each arm, and two on its back. It has short legs with small, narrow feet, each containing three toes. Its small white face is long and thin, tipped by its pink nose. Its eyes are set back, on either side of the bridge of the nose. Under them, on each side, are two thin, red stripes. A large blade roughly twice as large as its face extends from its forehead. The top of the blade contains two smaller blades, resembling fins. Its arms are thick and have three large blades instead of fingers, with two smaller blades on top of the middle ones. On its knees, halfway down its arm, and just behind where its forehead meets its face, are small red spots.\nDue to its evolution, Excadrill's drill has turned into steel. Excadrill can straighten its entire body, allowing it to spin like a drill. It can cut through iron and steel plating and it can dig at speeds of over 90 mph (150 km/h). Known as the \"Drill King\", it uses its excellent digging abilities to build a complex network of tunnels for its nest at more than 300 feet (100 meters) below the surface. Its tunneling can be both beneficial and harmful to humans, as it can help workers with its swift digging prowess for tunnel construction, but it can be detrimental to underground structures, such as subway tunnels.",

Audino has floppy ears with thin, curled extensions on the underside. It can use these ears as radars, and it has an incredible hearing ability.\nThe feelers on its ears act like stethoscopes in that it can feel the beat of another Pok\u00e9mon's heart, in order to assess the Pok\u00e9mon's feelings and overall physical condition. The feelers are also able to determine when an Egg is close to hatching. It has an incredible sense of hearing, where it can even hear a rolling pebble from a mile away.

Violet bulges resembling swelling veins pattern its muscular, large arms, thighs, and chest, and similar thick violet bands adorn its shoulders. It possesses an hourglass shape.\nIt is known to usually carry an I-beam girder in its arms. The steel frame is used to train its muscles, and Gurdurr boasts about its muscles with Machoke and other members of its kind. However, if the individual fails to measure up to the others, it will proceed to lay low for some time. It is so strong that it won't even be moved if it is attacked by a group of professional wrestlers. It is usually found near construction sites. Unlike Timburr, Gurdurr is not good at helping with construction; rather, it excels at demolition.",

Thick violet bands and tendons adorn its shoulders, chest, back, and thighs.\nIt is known to carry concrete pillars in its massive arms, which it uses to attack strongly without using physical strength or to support its massive upper body. However, when it goes all out, it will throw its pillars aside and jump at opponents to beat them with its fists. Conkeldurr can create concrete, a technique it was believed to have taught humans 2,000 years ago. Concrete that Conkeldurr has mixed is more durable than standard concrete, even when both forms of concrete have the same composition. It is often seen around construction sites, helping construction workers.",

Instead, it has two black-and-blue ringed cheeks akin to half-spheres on either side of its head. It has a long, blue tail with a fan-like shape and a black spot at its base.\nTympole vibrates its cheeks to create a sound too high-pitched for humans and other species of Pok\u00e9mon to hear. The sounds are used in rhythm to communicate with others of its kind, particularly for warning of danger. They are known to sing in high-pitched voices, which creates graceful ripples on the water's surface. The Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Black & White episode Facing Fear with Eyes Wide Open! reveals that Tympole swim and attack in groups.",

There are four round, light blue bumps starting on either side of its lower body and stretching across its back.

The ones on its head can shoot a paralyzing liquid, while the ones on its hands can be vibrated to increase its punching power. It can also vibrate the lumps as a source of torment for its opponents, or use them to create earthquake-like tremors. Seismitoad is popular among the elderly, who use the lumps' vibrations for massages. Seismitoad is known to wield venom, and is related to Croagunk and Toxicroak .",

The underside between the snout and its neck is white. Its green body has three segments with a pair of stubby, spherical orange legs on each segment. The bumps on Sewaddle's head are sensory organs.\nSewaddle makes itself leafy clothes using chewed-up leaves and a thread-like substance it produces from its mouth, though Leavanny tends to make its first set after hatching. By folding it over its face, its leafy hood is used to help hide it from enemies, whether awake or asleep. It has been shown to eat berries, but when food is scarce it will eat its leafy clothing as an alternative. Sewaddle is a very popular mascot used by fashion designers. Sewaddle tend to greet each by rubbing their bumps together.",

It drapes the leaves over itself and draws them closed around its body, so only a large, crescent slit remains for its face to appear. This leafy cloak keeps the Pok\u00e9mon warm. Under its cloak are darker green, limp leaves that frame the sides of Swadloon's face and trail down on the sides of its body. The top of the cloak has two semicircular leaves that form a V shape. These two head leaves allow Swadloon to detect air movements and feel the surrounding area. On its back are the veins of the leaf as well as a bit at the bottom tip of the cloak resembling a rounded tail. Swadloon lives on the forest floor and converts fallen leaves into nourishment, which helps the surrounding plant life grow.",

It has a broad, split-leaf around its large, round head and it has long antennae that end in semicircles. Its eyes are red with no apparent sclerae. Its tiny thorax is dark green, and its long abdomen is yellow and covered in a green leaf. Its hands are long and leaf-like with a \"bite\" taken out of each. Its upper arms are also leaf-like but with a vein of yellow at the top. Its hips are wide and Its slender legs are yellow with dark green, thick segments around its thighs, making them appear armored.\nLeavanny's arm blades are powerful enough to slice through a tree trunk with a single swing. It generally lives in forests. Leavanny is very parental and uses its cutters and the sticky silk it produces to create clothing made of leaves for small Pok\u00e9mon. Leavanny is known to make warm wrappings for young Sewaddle . It also warms its eggs with fermenting fallen leaves. While usually gentle, it will attack anyone or anything that harms young Pok\u00e9mon.",

A prominent ridge leading down to a pointed tip splits the top half of its head, and its lower jaw is black. It has round, heavy-lidded eyes that bulge away from the head slightly. Venipede's dark green abdomen is segmented, and it has four pairs of stubby black legs. Two short feelers banded with black extend from its hindquarters, which it uses in addition to its antennae to explore its surroundings and detect prey by sensing air vibrations.\nVenipede is brutally aggressive, and its bite injects a poison strong enough to paralyze large bird Pok\u00e9mon. Its fangs are known to be highly venomous. It often gets into fights with Sizzlipede , a related species. Venipede tends to prey on any Pok\u00e9mon it thinks it can eat without considering its actions thoroughly.",

Two poisonous barbs flank either side of each segment of its shell. The shell itself is gray, with red rings in the middle of each segment and a darker gray border circling its open center. Whirlipede's eyes can be seen within the center, and have slitted pupils, yellow sclerae, and thick, gray eyelids.\nWhirlipede remains motionless while storing energy for evolution, but will move to stab approaching predators with its poisonous spikes. If attacked, it can quickly spin its body like a wheel and crash furiously into opponents. It can move to about the speed of 60 mph.",

Its segmented body is dark magenta, except for its smooth, dark gray underside. Long, slightly bent horns similar to antennae extend from its head, as well as an identical pair of horns on its rear. Purple bands decorate these horns, and teardrop-shaped rings of the same color mark each body segment, one on each side of its body. It possesses four pairs of short, purple fore-claws on the body segments that make up its neck, which is used to inject poison. The four hind legs are longer, thicker, and spaced farther apart. Each hind limb has curved dark gray bands around the middle.\nScolipede lives in lush forests. It is very aggressive and will not give up until victorious. This Pok\u00e9mon chases down enemies with great speed and then attacks relentlessly with its horns until it prevails. It latches onto the prey using the toxic spikes on its neck, and then slams it into the ground for the deadly poison effect. Centiskorch is the natural predator or prey of Scolipede, depending on who wins the territorial fight.",

Despite weighing 14.6 lbs (6.6 kg), Whimsicott appears capable of \"riding upon the wind\" but whether this means they actually generate whirlwinds themselves or get carried by wind currents remains unclear.

            "description": "Petilil is a plant Pok\u00e9mon that resembles a plant bulb, such as an onion. It is primarily light green. Its head is tipped with three oblong leaves, whose color can determine how healthy the Petilil is. The leaves on its head reliably grow back if any fall off, and if they are pruned regularly, Petilil can be grown into a fine round shape. Its crescent-shaped white face, seemingly lacking a nose or mouth, has brown eyes shaped like elongated ovals. A green \"bib\" is present on its neck, and its lower body consists of five stubs, two of which act as arms, and two more act as legs.\nThe leaves on Petilil's head are very bitter, which can cause dizziness. However, these leaves possess revitalizing effects such as restoring a person's vigor. This can be achieved by eating the leaves directly, or drying and boiling them into an infusion. This infusion is also sometimes used as a bug repellent. Because of the health effects of its leaves, Petilil is very popular with the elderly.\nPetilil tends to appear near sources of clean waters. It lives in areas with soil abundant in moisture and nutrients. The homes can be either well-tended fields or flowerbeds. However, they will leave if the environment turns bad. This Pok\u00e9mon is a female-only species with no male counterpart.\nIn Hisui , the snowy mountainous landscape causes Petilil to gain the Fighting-type when it evolves into Lilligant .",

            "description": "Lilligant is a humanoid Pok\u00e9mon with plant characteristics. It dons a scarlet flower with white-spotted petals upon its head; said flower has golden filaments with red anther, resembling a crown. It possesses dark green, linear leaves under the flower, and light green, linear leaves underneath the darker leaves. One of the light green leaves, on the back of its head, is about as long as its body and resembles hair. Two light green leaves loosely hang down from its head. Its head and abdomen are white and its eyes, which resemble seeds, are a light shade of scarlet. It has dark green, linear leaves for arms, and a golden sepal under its neck. It wears a large, light green, tulip shaped collection of leaves, resembling a dress. There are two long, dark green, linear leaves coming from its back to around the bottom of its \"dress\". It also possesses another golden, sepal-shaped extension underneath its \"dress\", resembling feet.\nThough Lilligant is popular with celebrities, veteran Trainers and first-rate gardeners alike have struggled to coax the flower on Lilligant's head into blooming. The flowers bloomed by Lilligant in the wild are also said to be the most beautiful despite all these efforts. Once it blooms, it will wilt if Lilligant is then neglected or when it finds a male partner. The flower emits a sweet-smelling aroma, and it is believed to have a relaxing effect on those exposed to the scent. The flower's fragrance differs slightly depending on the soil it was cultivated in. The oil made by Lilligant's flowers has a sublime scent and is very expensive to buy. It is a rare Pok\u00e9mon that lives in forests. Lilligant is a female-only species with no male counterpart.",

            "description": "Basculin is a green aquatic Pok\u00e9mon that comes in three forms. The bodies of both the Red- and Blue-Striped Forms are the same. They have a green, ovoid body, tapering off in the rear to a trapezoidal tail fin. A thick black stripe covers the top of their body from mouth to tail and a white, dorsal fin with four protrusions resembling spikes. Their lower jaw juts ahead of their upper jaw, with a small indent near the edges of their mouth. Both forms have three black dots on both sides of their body, behind their pectoral fins. The main difference between the three forms of Basculin is the color of the stripe that separates the black and green on their body. All forms of Basculin have fins in the same places, with one on top of their body ahead of the tail fin, one below the body ahead of the tail fin, and two side fins. The Red-Striped Form has jagged fins that resemble tridents, whereas the Blue-Striped Form has smooth fins all around. The Red-Striped Form has circular, red eyes, while the Blue-Striped Form has narrower, blue eyes. Red- and Blue-Striped Basculin are extremely hostile, especially towards their opposite form. They generally start fighting each other on sight for territory. However, on rare occasions, one form may swim with the other's school. Basculin is full of vitality and reproduces quickly. When a school of Basculin appears in a lake, Pok\u00e9mon other than Corphish and Crawdaunt flee. It competes with Carvanha for food. Basculin has often been referred to as 'the thug of the lake' or 'Thug of the River', and uses its jaws, which are strong enough to leave bite marks in iron sheets, to devour everything in its way. However, despite their fierce reputation, Basculin become prey to stronger organisms, such as Bombirdier and Dondozo. Basculin were once also consumed by humans, and were considered very delicious. The meat of Blue-Striped Basculin has an inoffensive, light flavor, while the meat of Red-Striped Basculin is fattier, and was more popular with the youth. Basculin is a popular Pok\u00e9mon with anglers due to its resistance. Many people release Basculin into lakes illegally, causing its population to grow abundant. Basculin has three separate forms: Red-Striped Form, Blue-Striped Form, and White-Striped Form, the last of which is sometimes considered a regional form. In Hisui, White-Striped Basculin has a similar appearance to the other two forms of Basculin. Despite its descriptor, the stripes above its eyes are actually a very pale shade of light blue, as are its irises. Its pectoral fins are smooth like Blue-Striped Basculin, but larger. Its dorsal fins are spiky and it has wide eyes, like Red-Striped Basculin. Its lower jaw is smaller than the jaws of either Red- or Blue-Striped Basculin, and both its lower and upper jaws have beak-like protrusions at the front. Unlike the other two forms, White-Striped Basculin are known to be gentle, with an ecology different enough from other Basculin to spawn recent theories of it being a separate species. White-Striped Basculin are known to share food with each other unlike their two counterparts. They are known to travel upstream; the journey is often perilous for the species, and many of them don't survive. As a result, the souls of the deceased White-Striped Basculin are often left behind in the waters of Hisui. However, when an injured White-Striped Basculin survives, it can unite with the souls in order to achieve the unique evolution into Basculegion. In the present day, it's only known to be found in Kitakami's Timeless Woods along with its evolved form.",

            "description": "Sandile is a short, quadrupedal Pok\u00e9mon with a long snout and tail. Its body is mostly light brown with the exception of black stripes crossing over and under its legs and its pink underbelly. It has a black stripe on its snout in front of its eyes, and black covering the tip of its tail. Its eyes resemble shaded binoculars and are shrouded in a black membrane all around their front. This membrane prevents sand from getting in Sandile's eyes and helps it see in the harsh desert sun. Its long snout is tipped by two protruding nostrils, and its mouth comprises the bottom half. Its feet are flat and contain three sharp, black claws. They are attached to stubby legs on its sides.\nSandile is only found in deserts, with the exception of Alola , where the warm environment is comfortable enough for them to appear elsewhere. It usually burrows under the surface of the sand, with only its nose and eyes appearing above ground. Due to being so close to the surface, it can move around the desert and allow the heat of the sand to regulate its body temperature. This also serves as a way of hiding from enemies. Its movement through sand has been described as being similar to swimming. When the sun sets, it burrows deep into the sand to sleep until sunrise. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Black & White episode A Sandile Gusher of Change! , in the wild, Sandile can be mischievous and potentially troublesome to humans. However, Sandile will protect another of its species, and can be caring at times. Sandile is an ambush predator, hiding under the sand and waiting for unwary prey, such as Trapinch , to walk over it before it bites on their legs. However, Sandile is not very skilled at hunting prey, thus it also mostly eats anything that collapses in the desert; hence it has been known as \"the cleaner of the desert.\"",

            "description": "Krokorok is a reptilian Pok\u00e9mon with a mostly tan body, pink stomach, black back, and long tail. It is classified as a quadruped, though it is more often seen on two legs. It has six thick, black stripes on its body: one at shoulder level, one around its midsection, one around its hips, and three on its tail. Each stripe is topped with a triangular spike on its back. The stripes around its midsection cross two spikes, one on each side of its back. Its arms are short and thin, with a black band around them at the elbow. Each hand contains three short fingers, each with a white claw. Its legs are thick with a band around each ankle, and a stripe above the knee that does not wrap around. Its flat feet each have three white claws. Krokorok's head is ovoid with a long snout, and small eyes surrounded by a thick black membrane. Two of its front and rear teeth are visible overlapping its lower jaw. A black stripe sits on the bridge of the snout just behind its large nostrils.\nKrokorok prefers to live in the desert, usually in small groups. The black membrane surrounding its eyes protects them from sandstorms and acts as a thermal detector. This allows Krokorok to see the temperature of different objects, which also gives it exceptional night vision. This enables it to hunt in the dead of night without getting lost. However, it never moves much during the night. A group of Krokorok usually consists of a few individuals. The group is led by a female Krokorok while the males gather food. Krokorok dislikes feeling cold, so it burrows into the desert sand at night. It tends to bury its prey in the sand to preserve them in the event of an unsuccessful hunt.",

            "description": "Krookodile is a crocodilian Pok\u00e9mon that has a thick maroon-colored body, black back, and white stomach. It has five triangular spikes on its back: four around the middle of its back and one large one at the beginning of its tail. All of the smaller spikes on its back are linked to black, triangular spikes that reach around to its front, slightly overlapping its white stomach. The largest spike sits at the beginning of its long thick tail, which has three, thick, black stripes. The last stripe covers the tip of the tail. Its legs are very short and directly attached to its feet. The feet are wrapped in black and have three white claws facing forward. Krookodile's arms are short and thin with a black stripe around the elbow. Its long, thin fingers are each tipped with a white claw.\nIts head is slightly pointed and contains a distinctive black membrane that surrounds both eyes. The outline of the membrane angles upward sharply, coming to points above the top of Krookodile's head. It uses this distinctive look to harshly intimidate opponents. Its eyes are very powerful, with variable focus, allowing it to see things at a great distance, even in the middle of a desert. Its other notable feature is its long snout, containing a black stripe around the bridge, and large pointed nostrils on the end. Four of its rear and two of its front teeth slightly overlap its lower jaw. Krookodile's jaws are extremely powerful, giving it the ability to crush objects as large and durable as an automobile. The jaws can twist a body before breaking it in half. These features are topped by Krookodile's extremely violent temper. It has been known to clamp down on any moving object and will do everything it can to make sure its prey cannot escape. Krookodile coexists well with Flygon in searching for food, hiding in the sandstorms that Flygon creates as they hunt, then splitting the prey that they manage to catch.\nKrookodile has been known as the \"Bully of the Sands\". It uses the sandy terrain as cover to patiently wait for prey to pass by, even throughout the day without rest. Krookodile can swim through the desert sands as if they were water. Not even a thick metal plate is able to withstand a Krookodile's strong jaw bite.\nPrior to Generation VIII , Power Trip was its signature move , but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .",

It has three yellow ovals on its abdomen and a curvy yellow line on its back. Its hands and feet are orange with three digits each.\nDarumaka has a flame inside its body. While this flame is burning, Darumaka is very active. It cannot calm down in this state, and thus becomes uncontrollable. As the flame shrinks, it falls asleep; at rest, its internal temperature is about 1,100\u00a0\u00b0F (600\u00a0\u00b0C). It tucks in its arms and legs when it rests; during that time, it slightly sways. While it is sleeping, it cannot be tipped over no matter how much it is pushed or pulled, like a tumbler doll , which it resembles in this state. Darumaka is well known as a symbol of good luck. It is also known to have very warm droppings , which ancient people put in their clothes to keep themselves warm. It prefers to live in a desert environment.",

The upper portion of its tan face is separated from the lower portion by a diagonal red stripe, and its large mouth sports spiked teeth. All these facial features give the impression of a manic or angered expression. Its head has no discernible neck to distinguish it from the rest of the body and its rounded back, which culminates in a stubby tail. It has long arms with spiky hair fringes on the wrists and large tan hands, with a similar arrangement for its hind limbs. Additionally, Darmanitan has three tan ovals on its underside and two wavy lines on its back. In its normal state, it has immense physical strength; a single punch can destroy a dump truck. Its power level scales with the temperature of its internal fire, which can be as hot as 2,500 \u00b0F (1,400 \u00b0C). Darmanitan has a long lifespan as one was recorded living for 2,500 years while sleeping in Zen Mode around Relic Castle.",

Other dark green spiky arrangements adorn its neck, wrists, and the base of its body where the green spikes are arranged in a five-pointed star.\nWhen Maractus moves its body rhythmically, it emits sounds reminiscent of maracas being played. This allows Maractus to produce up-tempo songs and dances that it can use to scare away predators. Avian Pok\u00e9mon in particular may try to feed on its flower seeds.\nMaractus live in arid regions and dry desert -like areas.",

It ties with Minior and Carbink as the shortest Rock-type .\nWhen finding a rock to use as its shell, Dwebble inspects the rock to see if it can be used, then it digs a hole in the rock's bottom. It can expel a corrosive spray from its mouth to help it carve such a hole, or to mend its shell. If the rock breaks, Dwebble won't calm down until it can find a replacement. Its search for suitable rocks makes it a natural enemy of Roggenrola and Rolycoly .

It carries its loose, yellow skin around its legs, resembling trousers, which garner them more respect the saggier they are. Some of the loose skin seems to trail off to form or cover a tail.\nThis pelt is rubbery and can be raised to its neck to reduce the damage it takes from attacks. Scraggy is easily engaged in battle, as it will attack anyone that so much as meets its gaze with a headbutt from its thick cranium. The skull is extremely hard. They are known to take pride in their sturdy skulls, causing them to suddenly headbutt everything. However, the weight of its skull makes it hard for Scraggy to balance itself. Scraggy travel in small groups, walking around lazily. Scraggy is said to evolve into Scrafty once its skin is completely stretched out.",

As shown in the animated series , it can wear this skin like a hood. Scrafty's body is orange, with thin arms and a gray, scaled belly. Its lower body and tail are covered by loose yellow skin resembling baggy trousers. On its tail is a single red scale.\nScrafty is powerful enough to kick through concrete blocks used by Conkeldurr , and can also spit acidic liquid from its mouth, which it does to taunt opponents. It can protect itself while attacking by pulling up or folding the loose skin around its waist. Scrafty lives in groups with other members of its species. Groups determine hierarchy by crest size, with the Scrafty having the largest crest becoming the leader. A group will attack anything that comes within its territory. Scrafty never leaves its territory for a long time. Though often coming off as rude, it takes good care of its loved ones and its turf. Scrafty never leaves the territory it watches over its whole life long.",

White, sharp fangs create a taunting smile, and flamboyant patterns veil the coffin. The coffin is said to be made of solid gold. Cofagrigus is seemingly a distant relative of Runerigus .\nAncient legends once told Cofagrigus could seal nearby humans in their bodies and turn them into mummies; grave robbers who mistake them for normal coffins get this fate. Cofagrigus is said to have once been human but having forgotten its memories from when it was alive. They also enjoy eating gold nuggets. It lives in tombs and ruins waiting for victims. Cofagrigus has been used as a symbol for the wealth of kings from a bygone era.\nIn a fantasy sequence depicted in Raid Battle in The Ruins! , Cofagrigus is shown to be able to open its body like a sarcophagus.\nCofagrigus and its pre-evolution, Yamask , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Mummy as an Ability .",

It once lived in the sea millions of years ago and is now considered extinct. It hides in its shell to imitate a boulder to ambush prey. Carracosta has extremely strong jaws, allowing it to eat steel frames and rocks, in addition to prey, devouring every last piece of flesh and shell or bone. This diet allows Carracosta to develop a thick and sturdy shell. Carracosta is an active hunter on both land and sea. However, it moves slowly on land, so once it finds prey on land, Carracosta drags it into the water to finish it off. It preys on Omanyte and Omastar .",

            "description": "Archeops is a large, avian Pok\u00e9mon that bears traits of both birds and reptiles. Its featherless, scaly snake-like head is red with a green stripe running along the top. Its mouth is filled with sharp teeth. Its eyes are white with black pupils and no irises. Its body is covered with frayed-looking yellow and blue feathers designed for flight on its arms and legs enabling all four of its limbs to act as wings. All of these \"wings\" bear sharp claws. It has a ring of smaller green feathers on the ankles. Its tail is completely red and featherless except for a fan of blue feathers at the end, and as with the Archaeopterygiformes , it has fully-movable vertebrae in its tail instead of a pygostyle . Its plumage is very delicate.\nIt is capable of flying, but is more adept at running, taking a running start to take flight with its weak wing muscles. To achieve flight, Archeops must run nearly 25 mph (40 km/h) as it builds up speed over a course that is 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) long. Archeops can hunt more efficiently when on the ground. Archeops is known to be intelligent, hunting for its prey in packs. One Archeops first corners the prey before another swoops down on it. It can outrun even an automobile. It has the intelligence to work with its partners to catch prey. Archeops are extinct but can be revived via fossils. Archeops is omnivorous; along with hunting for prey, it was shown eating fruit in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Black & White episode Archeops In The Modern World! .\nArcheops and its pre-evolved form, Archen , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Defeatist as an Ability .",

Trubbish has oval-shaped eyes and large triangular teeth that resemble broken glass. Its arms look like trash spilling out of small tears in the bag with pink and blue objects protruding out of them. Its feet are dark green and stubby.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon was created when a mixture of domestic and industrial waste underwent a chemical reaction of some sort. Trubbish emits noxious, burp-like gases which, when inhaled, will render the victim bedridden for a week. This gas can also prove fatal when inhaled by young Pok\u00e9mon and children. As evidenced in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Black & White episode Here Comes the Trubbish Squad! , Trubbish's ear-like tufts stand straight up when startled, are lifted if happy, and lowered if it is feeling down. Furthermore, in the same episode, it is also explained that once Trubbish befriends a person, it will cease expelling foul odors. It prefers unsanitary places, such as garbage dumps, where it finds trash and other rotten stuff such as moldy apples for food. Alolan Grimer is a common enemy of Trubbish, and Alolan Muk preys on it. Galarian Weezing feed on the fumes produced by Trubbish.",

It has a round, lumpy body that is mostly tan with blue and pink lumps. Its head has the appearance of the tied end of a garbage bag that has been ripped open and trails down like a cape. It has two appendages that look like clumps of garbage coming from its head. Its large, round eyes have small pupils, and when it opens its mouth, its large, triangular teeth can be seen. Garbodor has two long arms made of garbage; one held together with piping, with fingers also made up of piping material, and the other held together with rebar. It has one finger on its left hand and three on the other. It also has flat, dumpy feet.\nGarbodor is able to spray poisonous gas and filth from its fingertips, but only from its right hand. The toxic liquid from its right arm is so virulent, it can kill a weakened foe instantly. If that filth is blocked, its arm can swell up, causing it considerable pain and discomfort. It can also finish off opponents by belting them with its left arm and spewing an awful-smelling toxic gas from its mouth. Garbodor prefers to live in unsanitary places such as garbage dumps, where it devours garbage in order to grow larger. Consuming garbage also allows Garbodor to create poisons in its body, the type of which depends on the kind of garbage eaten. Alola was once home to many Garbodor, but the population shrank precipitously after Alolan Grimer and Muk , which prey on Garbodor, were introduced to its habitat. This is said to have made the remaining Garbodor population stronger than its counterparts from other regions.",

Zorua can change its physical appearance, though this transformation is merely an illusion as it keeps its own type and moves.\nZorua is said to have a timid nature which led to the development of its illusion abilities. Zorua keeps its true form hidden to ensure its safety and takes on the appearance of other Pok\u00e9mon to frighten off enemies. It can let loose pitch-black shock waves against its targets. Sometimes it will take the form of a silent child in order to search for food. It has been known to occasionally replace normally talkative children. As seen in its movie debut , the tail of an unpracticed Zorua may remain when it takes on a human form, and if the tail is touched, it will revert to its true form. Zorua is mischievous and loves to surprise others.\nPrior to Generation VII , Zorua and its evolved form, Zoroark , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Night Daze . Additionally, Zorua and Zoroark, as well as their regional forms , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Illusion as an Ability .",

            "description": "Zoroark is a bipedal, slate gray, fox-like Pok\u00e9mon with crimson and black accents. It has a pointed snout and ears with red insides. It also has some red that rims its eyes and mouth. Zoroark has a large, red, voluminous mane with black tips, tied into a ponytail, as a teal bangle down its length separates a mass of the mane from the lower portion. It has a black ruff on its upper body, pointed at the shoulders from which its arms extend. Its upper arms are thin, whereas its lower arms, while still slim, are bulkier. The arms have spiky extensions of fur at the elbows, and it has red claws on its hands and feet. Zoroark's eyes are red-rimmed with light blue irises.\nZoroark can create illusions that are indistinguishable from reality, deluding many people simultaneously. It can even create illusory landscapes in the forests where it dwells, to hide its territory and protect its den. However, Zoroark is incapable of physically changing itself into another form; it is merely capable of casting illusions. When a Zoroark takes the form of a human, it is capable of human speech. It can make convincing illusions of attacks, and these illusions are extremely realistic, enough to fool even cameras and make one believe they're being physically affected, though the illusion does not have any direct physical effect. Lonely Trainers tend to use Zoroark to create illusions in order to ease their own burden of solitude. There are stories of Zoroark punishing people who tried to capture it with illusions.\nZoroark lives in groups, where unity is strong. It is extremely protective of those it cares about and will go to any lengths to keep them safe, including risking its own life, and it can hold grudges against those who harm its loved ones. Zoroark will hide its Zorua young in its mane to protect them and carry them around.\nPrior to Generation VII , Zoroark and its pre-evolved form, Zorua , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Night Daze . Additionally, Zoroark, its pre-evolved form, Zorua, and their regional forms , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Illusion as an Ability .",

A small tuft of hair sticks up from the top of its purple head, and it has two white, bow-shaped feelers on each side of the head and a third bow-shaped feeler on its neck. These ribbon-like feelers are used to amplify Gothita's psychic power, and will cause Gothita to cry if touched. It has two large blue eyes with three eyelashes on each and small red lips. Its torso is black with a white zigzagging line running horizontally through the middle. Its arms and legs are short and stubby with no visible digits.\nGothita intently observes those around it, looking at something only it can see. It can become so focused that it ends up being unaware of attacks. Gothita are normally known to be innocent. It is usually quiet, but sometimes it makes muted cries, even when alone. This is believed to be Gothita communicating with invisible beings.",

It has a pale purple face with cyan eyes and red lips. It has two white bows on its body, which flares at the bottom to form a skirt shape.\nGothorita uses starlight as the source of its power, and is able to use its psychic powers to arrange rocks into the shapes of constellations. It can also use these powers to control people and Pok\u00e9mon with hypnosis, leading people astray and putting children to sleep before kidnapping them. Because of this, Gothorita is known as the Witch of Punishment. Some people believe Gothorita is from outer space , although this connection is yet to be confirmed.",

Gothitelle's body is split into four progressively-larger tiers, with its head and arms being attached to the smallest, uppermost tier and with a pair of stubby pink feet being under them. Its arms are thin, ending in small, purple hands with white disks at the wrists. Each tier of Gothitelle's body has a white, bow-like fixture on its front.\nGothitelle's immense psychic power can distort the space around it, showing visions of distant stars and past events , but it dislikes conflict. It can predict the future from the placement and movement of stars and weeps when it discovers the lifespan of its Trainer. It has a detached nature due to seeing how all life will eventually end. A criminal that a Gothitelle had shown his fate to went missing that same day and was never seen again. The visions Gothitelle shares are said to be apparently ethereal and beautiful.",

A small circular piece of matter floats inside this substance over this Pok\u00e9mon's head. It has two brains, which think independently, causing it to attempt two different actions at once. However, when its brains think alike, it exhibits greater psychic powers, which are said to be able to travel half a mile away.",

Its eyes are black and oval, while its mouth is red and triangular. Its body is small with stubby arms and legs. However, there are several round objects floating next to its arms. These objects increase in size and darken in color the further they are from the body and form arm-like appendages. The gel around these appendages forms three-fingered hands. Above its head, two rounded, triangular objects are suspended in the gel, giving the impression of horns or ears. The gel forms a stubby, round tail at the base of Reuniclus's body.\nReuniclus controls its powerful arms using psychic powers. It can form a network with the brains of other Reuniclus by clasping hands with them. It is said that the power of Reuniclus is so great, it can crush boulders psychokinetically. Although capable of using its psychic powers in battle, Reuniclus prefers to use its large arms to pummel opponents. Drinking the liquid covering Reuniclus's body is said to grant wisdom; however, the liquid is extremely toxic.",

Swanna's legs are small, and its webbed feet are dark.\nSwanna is known to fly for thousands of miles without rest, and it flies out when the sun rises. At dusk, flocks of Swanna will dance, with the leader in the middle of the routine. Swanna is quite physically powerful for its graceful appearance as its beak can deliver forceful blows. Many artists have claimed to have taken inspiration from a Swanna performing a beautiful dance during the light of dawn.",

Beneath this lies its actual head, which is made of the same icy material as its body. It has dark blue eyes, a dark-blue mouth, and light blue crystals on its cheeks. Its small body is adorned with specks of ice and has stubby arms. The snow on a Vanillite's head can melt with heat or repeated touching, leaving its head exposed. If seen in this state, Vanillite become embarrassed.\nVanillite are born from icicles that are hit by morning sunlight and wish not to melt. It can blow winds with temperatures as low as \u221258\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221250\u00a0\u00b0C), which causes it to create ice crystals and make it snow in nearby areas when it exhales. It sleeps buried under snow and gains energy from the morning sun. In hotter regions, it is treasured by households, though it shrinks little by little. Glalie is a natural predator of Vanillite.",

There are light blue ice crystals to the side of each eye and two under each mouth. It has two stubby arms and three spikes under its body, all of which resemble icicles. The middle spike under its body is the largest, and there is a hollow, straw-like structure on top of the left head. On the back of its two heads there are many small ice crystals.\nVanilluxe has a body temperature of about 21\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22126\u00a0\u00b0C). It ingests large quantities of water, which it uses to create internal snow clouds. If it loses a head, it can still live problem-free. When its two heads are in agreement or simultaneously angered, it can expel powerful blizzards from its two mouths. It can create snow anywhere, which makes it popular among skiers and snowboarders.",

The upper side of its body is pink in the spring, green in the summer, orange in the autumn, and brown in the winter. Deerling has a yellow-patterned rim, and its underside is peach. It sports a yellow floral tuft on its head with small antlers hidden underneath, and similar yellow coloration on the insides of its tapering ears. The tips of its limbs are colored black and its pink tail is small.\nIf Deerling senses animosity, it will hide in tall grass. It moves in herds, as it is timid around humans. Despite this, Deerling does whatever it wants, even around humans. Deerling will take a liking towards anyone who feeds it. It will playfully headbutt anyone it likes, even if headbutts are a little painful. It dwells in sparsely populated areas, away from humans. It is herbivorous. Despite their innocent and adorable appearance, Deerling are considered pests by farmers, as they tend to eat all of their plant shoots. Because of this, and because Lycanroc is a natural enemy of Deerling, farmers often use Lycanroc to guard their fields from Deerling.",

Its feet are white and fairly small and its black tail is in a jagged shape.\nEmolga lives in treetops, sometimes in holes gouged by Pikipek , and uses its flaps to glide from tree to tree. It generates electricity in the electric sacs on its cheeks, stores it in its membrane, and discharges it while gliding. Emolga does this in order to be able to scare off bird Pok\u00e9mon, giving it the capability to gather lots of food. It then grills its food, being berries or bug Pok\u00e9mon, with electric shocks before eating. Due to its tendency to stuff its cheeks with food, Emolga sometimes has difficulties flying. While Emolga is cute, it tends to cause trouble.",

Its shoulders have large, round metal ridges, from which its thin black arms extend. The arms are tipped with red-striped protrusions resembling jousting lances. Its face and torso are bare of armor, but its lower body is concealed within a swirled gray shell with a red spike on the underside, which was presumably the shell of a Shelmet .\nIts tough armor protects its entire body. It flies around at high speed, jabbing foes with its lances. It is brave and will face any challenge even if in trouble. Escavalier is a popular Pok\u00e9mon in the Galar region , with a famous painting showing it dueling Sirfetch'd .",

A theory suggests that the developer of modern Pok\u00e9 Balls actually modeled it after Foongus's cap due to liking the Pok\u00e9mon, although this is supposition.\nFoongus uses its Pok\u00e9 Ball-like pattern to lure people and Pok\u00e9mon in grassy areas, before releasing a cloud of poisonous spores to defend itself. The spores can be used as a stomach medicine if thoroughly dried. Foongus moves by either hopping or turning on its side and rolling on its cap. It is one of the shortest Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon. It prefers damp places, such as around trees.",

It has red eyes with blue sclerae and a straight eyelash on each eye, its collar is wavy, and it appears to be frowning, but in the animated series it is shown to smile rarely. As a female, it is pink, with wavy appendages and a round crown. It has blue eyes with red sclerae and a curled eyelash on each eye, its collar is frilled, and it appears to be smiling.\nFrillish is a hadopelagic Pok\u00e9mon which lives in dens about 5 miles (8 kilometers) under the sea surface. Because of this, it can cope with extremely dark and highly pressurized sea conditions. It is carnivorous; it gently floats around in waves until it can strike its prey. It makes its victim numb with the use of its poison spikes and takes it to its deep den. Its arms are filled with tens of thousands of poisonous stingers. There is a legend where Frillish are said to have been created from transformed residents of a sunken ancient city. Frillish preys on Magikarp and Lanturn . Female Frillish have slightly longer stingers on their arms, while male Frillish have bigger collars.",

The remaining three are short and tapered. A male is blue with a short, white crown, and a white, mustache-like collar. Its eyes are red with blue sclerae, and there is one eyelash over each eye. Its long tentacles have white edges, while its short tentacles have white spots. A female is pink with a tall, white crown and a puffy, white collar. Its eyes are blue with red sclerae and surrounded by two eyelashes. Its mouth is red and heart-shaped. The long tentacles have white edges like the male, but the short ones have white frills.\nJellicent can absorb seawater and project it from its head, which lets it move forward in the sea. Jellicent's body composition is similar to seawater. Schools of Jellicent are known to gather for prey during a full moon. Any fancy cruise ships, tankers, or crew that wander into the oceans where it dwells are never found again, and it is rumored that it drags these ships or tankers into the sea and preys on its passengers. It can create lairs from sunken ships. It is known to feed on life energy, where the more it drains, the bigger its crown gets. Jellicent are highly feared by fishers.",

The shape of the Pok\u00e9mon resembles an ocean sunfish, as it lacks a proper tail fin. Its eyes are round with golden irises and a mark that appears to be an eyelash extending up and back toward the rest of the body. Alomomola's entire body is enveloped in a special membrane that can heal wounds.\nAlomomola lives in the open seas. If it finds an injured Pok\u00e9mon floating at sea, it will heal the Pok\u00e9mon's wounds using its membrane and carry it back to shore. Alomomola does this because any predators coming for the injured Pok\u00e9mon could also come for Alomomola. Alomomola swims alongside smaller Pok\u00e9mon to accompany them; thus, many water Pok\u00e9mon gather around it. Fishermen take Alomomola during long voyages, saving the need to have a doctor or medicine on ships.",

Its ovoid body is completely covered in yellow fur, with notable tufts sticking out on each side of its face, just over each eye, and its lower back. Joltik has four blue eyes. The two larger eyes are set relatively far apart on its face, containing black pupils. The two smaller simple eyes are situated between the first pair, slightly higher up on its face. Joltik's mandibles point downward and reside at the bottom of its face, where they closely resemble tufts of hair. It is capable of producing silk from these mandibles, enabling it to hang from trees.\nAt 4 inches (0.1 meters) tall, Joltik is one of the shortest Pok\u00e9mon in existence. In fact, it is too small to generate its own electricity, so it attaches itself to larger Pok\u00e9mon and feeds off their static electricity. More than often it prefers sticking on Yamper 's hindquarters. It will also make its way into houses and feed off electricity in electrical sockets. All of the energy it absorbs it stores in an electric pouch on its body. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Black & White episode Oshawott's Lost Scalchop! , Joltik is not especially aggressive, but will defend itself if bothered. In the episode Crisis at Chargestone Cave! , it's shown that if Joltik is unable to find a source of energy, it will be unable to move and be put in serious danger. Joltik mainly lives in caves and cities with electricity.",

            "description": "Galvantula is a yellow arachnid Pok\u00e9mon . Its body consists of a head and abdomen. Its head is yellow on top and light purple on the bottom. It has two large, blue, forward-facing eyes with black pupils, and four, smaller, simple eyes sitting in a 2\u00d72 pattern on its forehead. It has two long pedipalps connected from the underside of its head, which are blue and hairless on their lower half and covered in thick yellow fur on the upper half. Galvantula's body is covered in yellow and light purple fur on top with blue fur under its abdomen. Four tufts of hair sprout from under its abdomen and grow upward. Two large tufts sprout from the left and right of the rear, while two smaller ones sprout from each side. The fur on its back is light purple and with three thick, yellow stripes running up from its rear. Despite being based on a spider, Galvantula has only four legs. Each leg is connected to the head by a blue upper half. The lower half is covered in yellow fur and forms a bell-shape over its blue, conical feet.\nGalvantula likes to use electrically charged silk to ensnare prey. Galvantula preys on the chicks of bird Pok\u00e9mon that cannot fly, by placing electrified threads near the nests. Galvantula attacks its foes with electricity by using the fur located on its abdomen. The electricity stuns the victim which can last three days and three nights. This allows Galvantula to consume the target at its leisure. Its pedipalps are very strong, allowing Galvantula to hold down unruly prey. It also uses electric webs to defend itself from threats. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Black & White episode Scraggy\u2014Hatched to be Wild! , Galvantula is not particularly aggressive unless provoked. If bothered, it may attack in groups. In the episode Crisis at Chargestone Cave! , it is shown to be extremely caring and protective of its pre-evolved form, Joltik, and will aggressively find ways to help it.",

It has a metallic body with black stripes and polygonal spots, along with small yellow eyes with black pupils.\nFerroseed prefer living in mossy caves. It can stick its spikes into cave walls to absorb the minerals from the rocks. If threatened, it can shoot a barrage of spikes so it can escape by rolling away. Ferroseed's aim at throwing spikes will not be good at first, requiring practice to improve it. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Black & White episode Crisis at Ferroseed Research! , Ferroseed can absorb nutrients from rocks and use them to grow moss for oxygen; different rocks create different types of moss with a variety of effects. Notably, its spikes can grow big and strong from consuming the moss. Absorbing nutrients from rocks that come from Chargestone Cave yields disastrous results.\nPrior to Generation VII , Ferroseed and its evolved form, Ferrothorn , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Iron Barbs as an Ability .",

Prior to Generation VII , Shift Gear was also one of its signature moves. Once two bodies have joined, they cannot combine with any others or they will become separated. Klink generates its life energy by spinning, and is generally found in caves. According to Professor Juniper , the first recorded evidence of this Pok\u00e9mon dates to around 100 years ago, in the Chargestone Cave ; she believes that it suddenly appeared in the cave at that time. However, it is also believed that Klink are the inspiration behind the first gears invented by ancient people.",

            "description": "Klinklang is a Pok\u00e9mon resembling four interlocking gears, with six teeth on the smaller two gears and eight teeth on the larger gear. The fourth gear is on its lower side, and is red-topped with a thin, spiked rim below it. The red core is used to store energy gained from the rotating gears. This energy can be released through the spiked gear at the bottom. The teeth of the smaller gears are a light gray, while their central regions are much darker. The teeth of the larger gear are a medium gray and its central region is darker. The left eye of the smaller gear is a white \"X\", while its right eye has a black pupil and a white sclera. It has a round green nose and a small mouth. The largest gear appears to have a face with a black square for its right eye, a black circle for its left eye, and a sharply angled white frown.\nDialogue between the two faced gears in the Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon series suggests that both gears are independently sentient from one another. However, the spike gear it gains after evolving is not actually alive. Klinklang's red core is able to contain an enormous amount of energy, which it uses to launch gears as well as powerful blasts of electricity from its spikes.\nKlinklang and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Gear Grind . Prior to Generation VII , Shift Gear was also one of its signature moves. Its red core gear can spin at high speeds to rapidly charge itself with energy.",

It is willing to help in stressful and otherwise difficult situations. However, Elgyem can become fully involved in something it feels to be important and protect that with its life.

On top of its head is a black covering, which resembles a lampshade , with a pointed spike on top. Underneath its head is a small, black body with a pointed spike at the bottom. Extending from its body are two long, wavy arms with no fingers. It floats through the air to move.\nLampent can sense when someone is about to die, whom it visits and steals the spirit from the person's body. Though most often found in deep forests, it quietly wanders through cities and hangs around near hospitals to absorb the spirits of the fallen. It also pretends to be a lamp while in cities. Because of this, Lampent is feared as the emissary of death. It uses the spirits it has absorbed to fuel its fire. On occasion, it has been known to work with Litwick to lead people to the Ghost World while stealing life energy.",

There is a ring of small, black spikes on top of its head with a tall, purple flame in the middle. From a black spike below its head, black arms curl upward. These arms are tipped with purple fire.\nChandelure's flames do not burn their victims physically; rather, they burn the victim's spirit. After hypnotizing its opponent by waving these flames, it absorbs the victim's spirit. It is said that any spirits that get incinerated by Chandelure's flames end up losing their way and are forced to wander the mortal world forever. Chandelure is known to reside in rundown mansions. There is a rumor that funerals were a constant occurrence for people that lived in homes that were illuminated by Chandelure in place of lights.",

In ancient times, people used Axew's discarded tusks as cooking knives.\nThe back of Axew's head is dark grayish-green with a tall, slightly curved horn. Large, dark grayish-green ovals surround its red eyes, and it has a short, rounded snout with large nostrils. A forest green collar marking encircles its neck.

Its arms have three red fingers, and its lower body is gray, with red speckles on the underbelly. It has red toes and a red tip on its tail.\nFraxure is very violent and territorial. Fights over turf often break out between it and another Fraxure. After a fight, it sharpens its tusks on river rocks, as they do not regenerate. It lives alongside rivers. Fraxure engages in violent confrontations with Bisharp for the locations of sharping stones. Fraxure uses its tusks only when necessary. The reason is once its tusks break, Fraxure will be unable to use it again. Fraxure uses its tusks to cut the prey in two different food portions, one for eating now and the second portion for later.",

Its large tusks, which resemble axe blades, are black and edged in red, and are located on its upper jaw on the side of its mouth. Its medium-sized eyes are red with black pupils. Ridged plate-like skin travels from its back to its head region. It has solid armor and the legs and tail have a dividing line pattern. Its arms are quite small, with three digits, two elliptical triceps and biceps, and circular elbows. Its hands are small and circular with small red claws. Its legs are formidable and strong with three-toed feet with a red talon on each toe.\nHaxorus takes great pride and joy in its prized, unbreakable tusks, which are used on its enemies and can cut through steel beams and metal transmission towers with ease. Despite its austere appearance, it is generally friendly. However, Haxorus is known to be very territorial, and it will react violently should anyone touch its tusks. Haxorus is known to reside in caves and abandoned mines. Haxorus has a diet of eating the minerals in the dirt to keep its tusks sharp.",

Three spikes of ice hang from its lower jaw, forming a beard. Its large forepaws have black claws and paw pads.\nBeartic is capable of freezing its own breath, and will create pathways across oceans using this technique. Should it get tired while swimming, Beartic will also use its breath to freeze the water it is swimming in so that it can lay down and rest. Its ice breath can create fangs and claws of ice, the former being harder than steel. It inhabits northern areas where it catches prey in the cold waters. Once it captures its prey, it freezes them with its breath to preserve. It has a ferocious temperament, which has earned it the \"Snow-White Demon\" moniker. In Lental , it fights with Mamoswine for territory. Despite its otherwise fierce demeanor, Beartic is known to be protective around Cubchoo .",

Its facial expression is frozen, which leaves Cryogonal with a still, aggressive-looking face. Two cracks run through its face: the upper opening contains its eyes, and the lower serves as a mouth. It has two glowing eyes and its large mouth contains an extendable chain of ice, which is used for hunting.\nCryogonal is born in snow clouds, although there are rumors stating that it is born from people and Pok\u00e9mon that have died on snowy mountains. When its body heat rises, it will turn into steam and vanish, but it will revert to ice when the body temperature lowers. As a result, Cryogonal is rarely seen during the summer, and are commonly seen during winter seasons. Cryogonal uses its ice chain to capture its prey and freeze them at a temperature of -148 \u00b0F (-100 \u00b0C), before taking them to unknown locations.",

Its arms, when crossed, portray an aggressive mood.\nIt is a very fast Pok\u00e9mon and attacks in ways similar to ninjas. In Generation VIII , Water Shuriken was its signature move . It lives in moist habitats like bogs and swamps. Accelgor is often featured as a main character in movies or comics to increase the popularity of these products. Accelgor's pouting expression and crossed arms are due to it being miserable over having lost its shell. [1]",

It has two small, flimsy fins at the sides of its body; each with two lobes. It has been seen to leap into the air and flap its fins as if they're wings to remain airborne.\nStunfisk lives in mudflats and coastal areas, and thanks to the bacteria which lived alongside it, it developed the organs which it uses to generate electricity. Stunfisk's very tough skin keeps them unharmed if stepped on, even by sumo wrestlers. To exploit this, it buries itself in the mud of the seashore and waits for prey to pass by. Whenever unsuspecting prey touches a Stunfisk's body, it is zapped. Stunfisk smiles when electrocuting its foes for a reason that is still not yet known. If it cannot paralyze its foe, it contorts itself with unexpected speed and flops away.",

Its forehead has a purple spot adorning it as well as a yellow one on its snout. It possesses a pair of long, yellow-tipped whiskers which have split ends. Its arms are almost completely covered by a large amount of fur that is tipped in purple and split at the end, resembling long sleeves. Its torso has one purple ring of fur around its midsection. It also has purple fur on the bottom section of the torso, which resembles pants, and its bottom paws are clawed. It has a long, skinny tail that, like its paw fur, is tipped purple and split at its end. Mienshao is respectful and is usually seen training with its Trainer.\nWhen facing a truly challenging opponent, Mienshao will bite off the fur from its arms to make itself lighter. Its arm fur is used as a weapon in battle and acts like a battle whip. Before it attacks, it lets out a bizarre wail. It then creates combination attacks that are difficult to see and overwhelmingly unstoppable, and slowly stores up power for a finishing blow. When using its blinding speed, Mienshao can crush massive boulders into tiny pieces. A New Perspective demonstrates that Mienshao can extend the fur on its arms at will and stretch it far enough to tie its opponents.",

Its bright red head is harder than rock and is very rough. It has a set of glaring, ferocious pale yellow irises. Its arms are longer than its legs, giving it the appearance of a hunchback. It has a thick, moderately-sized tail and sharp white claws on both the hands and feet. It also has tall, conical, red spikes: three on each arm, one on each shoulder, two on each leg, and four on its tail. It has a blunt, brutal snout, bearing a maw with no discernible teeth; instead, small fang-like protrusions sprout from its jaws. It has a series of olive, ellipsoid scutes running across its belly.\nDruddigon is known to be vicious and cunning. It warms its body by taking in sunlight with its wings; if its body temperature lowers, it becomes immobile. It has savage physical strength; it nimbly chases prey around its den, using its outstretched claws to catch them, or charging into them face-first. Instead of making its own nest, it lives in caves and tunnels dug out by other Pok\u00e9mon, such as Diglett , Dugtrio , Onix , and Excadrill .",

Two pairs of crisscrossing brown bands extend around its spherical body meeting at a blue square with a yellow swirl in the center. Two large stone-like blocks act as its feet and two more such blocks adorn its \"forearms\"; each arm ends in a dark blue-colored, crude three-fingered hand.\nGolett is believed to burn energy inside its core in order to move; this energy also emanates light through the holes near Golett's arms and legs. However, this energy has yet to be identified by researchers. Allegedly \"active for thousands of years\", Golett's animating energy is speculated to run out soon. For unclear reasons, Golett have been reported to continually line up boulders.",

It has a small head compared to its body, and pale yellow eyes, one of which turns to its left at the bottom, unlike Golett 's eye, which turns right. There is a crack across the chest of the armor, which is patched diagonally with a brown seal resembling a belt. It has a crystal-like formation on each shoulder, and there are large bangles on its wrists and ankles. It has a Roman armor-like \"skirt\" and flat feet beneath. There is an unproven theory that Golurk contains a perpetual motion machine that creates a limitless amount of energy.\nDespite its large size, Golurk is capable of flying by retracting its hands into its arms and its legs and feet into its body, then taking off like a rocket at Mach speeds. It is also capable of forming a cannon by pulling its legs into its body and standing on its hands, as seen in Pok\u00e9Park 2: Wonders Beyond , the animated series , and the Pok\u00e9mon Adventures manga. If the seal on its chest is removed, its energy runs wild, and its energy's color turns from yellow to red. This causes it to rage and fly around uncontrollably without being able to land itself. Removing the seal also causes Golurk to attack indiscriminately. A rampaging Golurk can turn a whole town into a mountain of rubble.\nGolurk is said to have been invented by ancient people to serve as a laborer and protector of people and Pok\u00e9mon. It also served as sentries on artillery platforms built into the walls of ancient castles, where it could fire energy beams. Golurk will faithfully follow its master's orders without question.",

            "description": "Pawniard is a small, bipedal Pok\u00e9mon with a vaguely beetle-like appearance. It has a rounded red and black head with a silvery blade extending from the front. Its face is gray with yellow eyes. Two pairs of steel blades protrude from either side of its black torso, connected by steel ribs. It has red arms that end with knife-like blades instead of hands. It also has red legs with two white toes located on both sides of each feet.\nWhen hunting, Pawniard immobilizes prey by repeated stabbing with its blades after clinging on to them. It then clangs its arm blades together afterwards. Any chips in Pawniard's blades would prove fatal for it; thus, Pawniard regularly sharpens its blades with its favorite sharpening stones found by rivers. Pawniard is noted to be an especially courageous fighter. In the wild, Pawniard lives in packs governed by Bisharp . The Pawniard will attack when commanded by Bisharp and will continue to do so even if they are injured. Each member of the pack trains diligently, hoping to one day take the lead. Tinkatuff is a natural enemy of Pawniard.",

            "description": "Bisharp is a bipedal, humanoid Pok\u00e9mon . It has a round, red and black head, similar to a war helmet, topped with a golden, double-headed axe blade with white edges. The helmet shrouds most of its yellow-and-black face, although its triangular eyes are visible. Resembling shoulder pads, Bisharp's red shoulders project slightly over its arms and have a thin yellow line where they meet its black torso. It has white, metallic hands that resemble gloves, with retractable, sharp blades attached. Encircling its torso are two blades, which create the impression of a ribcage. Its thighs are red and become progressively thinner as they connect to the knee. Both of its feet are metallic and split down the middle, resembling cloven hooves. These hooves are also similar to steel war boots or possibly leggings.\nIn the wild, Bisharp rules over a pack of Pawniard, and fights other Bisharp to become the alpha of the pack. The loser of these fights is cast out. It is notably pitiless, having no expression when finishing off prey, and is also said to use underhanded tactics during battles. When hunting, the Pawniard allow the leader Bisharp to perform the finishing blow. Once a Bisharp's head blade is chipped or damaged, it retires from its position as boss. Bisharp keeps a close eye on members of its pack to ensure none of the Pawniard think about betraying it, and absorbs defeated packs into its own tribe during territorial disputes. The Bisharp tribes are in turn spearheaded by Kingambit , which has been known to lead gangs of Bisharp into battle. It is said that only the most outstanding members of the Bisharp tribes can evolve into Kingambit. Bisharp typically lives near forested areas. It has violent conflicts with Fraxure over the locations of sharpening stones, and is often attacked by Tinkatuff for its metal.",

There are black tear markings directly below its eyes. Each of its beige legs has a single, gray hoof and its tail ends in a stubby tuft of fur.\nA territorial Pok\u00e9mon, it will headbutt anyone that attempts to invade its territory. However, in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Black & White episode Dreams by the Yard Full! , it is shown not to attack those with an afro hairstyle. Protected by its afro, which absorbs damage, its headbutts are strong enough to derail a train and send it flying. It can also destroy a car with just a Headbutt . The more hair a Bouffalant has on its head, the higher positions it has in the herd. A herd of Bouffalant consists of 20 individuals. For unclear reasons, a Bouffalant loses its hair from its head should it ever betray its herd.\nBouffalant is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Head Charge .",

            "description": "Rufflet is a small avian Pok\u00e9mon with a blue body. A large white plume of feathers covers its head and three tail feathers extend from its lower back. The feathery ruff extends down past its neck, covering the upper third of its body. Its face is blue with five pointed tips, resembling a mask and crown in contrast to the white feathers surrounding it. Extending from its forehead is a large feather, which is red on the lower half and white on the upper half. The split between the two colors on the feather resembles a zigzag pattern. Rufflet's beak is short and wide, with large eyes on either side. Each eye has a thick black iris with a small white pupil. Its yellow legs and feet are large in comparison to the body. Each foot has four digits: one backwards, and three forwards.\nThe thick, black talons on its feet are strong enough to break even the hardest of berries, and crack Shellder to consume their insides. Rufflet also preys on Spewpa . Rufflet is extremely aggressive from birth and knowingly provokes opponents larger and more powerful than itself, including its own parent to gain acceptance. It sees this as a means of quickly getting stronger. The more times Rufflet faints or gets injured, the stronger it becomes. Rufflet will start crying whenever it loses a battle. As a result of the harsh environment of Hisui , Rufflet gains an additional Psychic-type when it evolves into Hisuian Braviary . Rufflet is a male-only species.",

Its tail feathers are red, turning to yellow, and then blue at the tips. Braviary's legs are long and thick with yellow feet that each have a digit facing backward, and three facing forward. Each digit is tipped by a short, thick, black claw.\nBraviary has a long, thick beak with a blue cere . On either side of the cere are Braviary's eyes, which are black with small white pupils. Sprouting from above the eyes is a crest of three long, white feathers. At the base of the feathers is a red, W-shaped design that is spread across all three feathers. On each side of Braviary's face, sprouting out from behind the feathers on its forehead, are an additional three white feathers pointing horizontally and downward. Behind the three feathers on its head is a large mane of white feathers, draping over its neck. Combined, these features resemble a Native American war bonnet .\nBraviary is extremely aggressive, but for noble reasons. It is known for its bravery and pride, and will fight fiercely to help and protect its friends. Even if it is injured or has its life threatened, it will still fight. The more scars it has on its front, the more respect it gets from its peers. Scars on its back will bring it ridicule, however. It has earned the nickname \"the hero of the skies\" due to its extreme dedication for its friends. Aiding its valiance, Braviary is extremely strong, capable of lifting a car and flying with it. However, due to its hotheaded and belligerent nature, it was rejected from being the Flying Taxi carrier in Galar in favor of Corviknight . Braviary is usually seen as a motif for different emblems.",

Vullaby either finds this bone itself or uses one found for it by Mandibuzz . Its large appetite results in large growth spurts, resulting in Vullaby having to replace their bones, and they often pass older bones down to smaller Vullaby.

On its lower abdomen, back, and underside are raised, beige-colored bands that resemble pipes, leading to its tail. Heatmor's claws, on both its feet and hands, are a dull yellow and on its wrists are raised, dented bands; both the wrists and feet are beige-colored. Its tail is dented upward and has a hole in it, similar in appearance to a muffler . It also seems to serve the same purpose as a muffler, being able to expel gases, although it is able to take in air as well.\nDurant are the preferred prey of Heatmor. Heatmor expels flames from its mouth and uses it like a tongue, allowing it to burn through Durant's steel bodies before consuming their insides. It uses the hole in its tail to absorb air in order to keep its fire burning. Should the hole get blocked, Heatmor will become ill. In Generation VII , Fire Lash was its signature move .",

Its ovoid abdomen is dark gray with a light gray band wrapping around the middle and two circles resembling rivets near a jagged seam. Durant's thorax is slightly smaller, but identical in design with its abdomen. The only difference being one circle instead of two. Its head is spherical, containing the same light gray wrap design as its body. However, it wraps from front to back on the head. On each side of its head are large red eyes with hollow black pupils. Durant has two round mandibles that it uses to grab things and feed itself. The mandibles are attached below its eyes and are situated in front of its horizontally opening mouth. Atop its head are two long antennae, each tipped with small spheres. Durant has six black legs sprouting from its thorax. Each leg has one claw at its tip, except the front legs that each have two.\nDurant is extremely territorial. It only lives in colonies and digs mazes underground designed to be as complicated as possible. It grows steel armor to protect itself from its natural predator Heatmor . When they are under attack, Durant gathers in groups to attack as a whole to keep Heatmor away. They also gather together when protecting their eggs from Sandaconda . As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Black & White episode Battling the Leaf Thieves! , Durant prefers to eat vegetation, namely leaves. It will attack swiftly and aggressively if bothered, but will not pursue intruders once outside of its colony.",

It primarily lives in caves with abundant water sources but little food source, so it will eat anything that moves, and memorizes the scents of its favorite things that it has tasted. It has the vigor and energy to bite constantly, making it dangerous to approach without taking precautions.

There are tufts of fur over its heads with rounded points at the top. It has two thin wings on its back, each ending in two points. The fur stops at the chest and opens up to fuchsia striped bands on the side of its legs. Though it appears to lack eyes, it is unknown if Zweilous is blind.\nZweilous has the vigor and energy to eat and bite constantly without stopping. Its heads dislike each other and are very hostile. Each head has their own likes and dislikes. As a result, the heads often turn eating into a competition, each head trying to claim leadership by eating more than the other. Because of this, Zweilous always eats far too much and is covered in scars, even without opponents to fight. This allows Zweilous to become stronger without any allies helping it. It is a nomadic Pok\u00e9mon; it migrates once it has eaten all the prey in an area. However, Zweilous generally makes its habitat in caves.",

            "description": "Hydreigon is a three-headed, draconic Pok\u00e9mon with six thin, black wings that each end in two points on its back. Its body is primarily dark blue, with black fur covering its necks and shoulders. The inner fur surrounding its heads is fuchsia in color, and resembles collars. Hydreigon's heads have black eyes; the main head additionally has fuchsia pupils and visible pointed teeth, while the secondary head's eyes are simplistic and unable to blink. Its abdomen has two fuchsia stripes and its feet appear atrophied, having no claws or defined soles. Its tail also sports a fuchsia stripe and ends with a black tuft.\nHydreigon is a violent, destructive Pok\u00e9mon. It will attack anything that moves, determining it a foe. However, in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Black & White episode Cameron's Secret Weapon! , Hydreigon is depicted as fairly obedient when around its Trainer . The three heads take turns when attacking, not stopping until their target is defeated. Hydreigon can also use its three mouths to rapidly eat through anything. Despite its three heads, it is a singular entity, unlike its pre-evolved form Zweilous ; its secondary heads lack brains and do not move or think of their own accord. Conversely, with its central head housing its brain, Hydreigon is said to be highly intelligent in spite of its constantly destructive thoughts. Hydreigon lives high up in the air and has been known to ambush opponents from above. Many stories described Hydreigon destroying entire villages. However, Hydreigon is afraid of Noivern during nighttime. It is said Hydreigon's reason for being ferocious is due to ancient people loathing it. The ancient people believed Hydreigon was evil incarnate, hence always attacking it.\nIron Jugulis shares a resemblance to Hydreigon. The reason is believed due to it being a possibly futuristic hybrid made from combining Hydreigon and machines together as one. It is also rumoured that Iron Jugulis is the child of a Hydreigon which fell in love with a machine.",

Its white mane of fuzz encompasses its head and the upper half of its body, while its lower half is brown. It has three pairs of small black legs. There are five red, slightly whorled horns on the sides of its head.\nLarvesta can shoot fire from its five horns as a defensive tactic to intimidate predators or to scare prey. It has been seen using the fire that it shoots from these horns to fly. Larvesta's flames can reach up to almost 5,500 degrees Fahrenheit in temperature. The horns' flames can cut through even sheets of iron. It lives at the feet of volcanoes, though people of ancient times once believed that Larvesta nested on and fell from the sun; some people still say that it was born from the sun. In ancient times, it was known as the Larva That Stole the Sun and emissary of the sun . Despite this, Larvesta is considered a burden due to it causing constant forest fires. When it evolves into Volcarona , its body becomes enveloped in flames, akin to a cocoon.",

Its abdomen is black in the center and light blue with black dots on the outside. It has six leaf-like wings that are orange in color and have small black spots.\nVolcarona releases burning scales from its wings to engulf the battlefield in a sea of fire. Volcarona's flames are said to provide a replacement for the sun when the atmosphere is dark with volcanic ash, and some legends claim that it hatched from a cocoon of raging flames to save people and Pok\u00e9mon in freezing climates. It was feared as the rage of the sun by ancient people, and it was even worshiped as a deity of fire in some places, they even referred to it as the embodiment of the sun . Volcarona's shrine in Relic Castle remains as a testament to the respect it commanded. Despite being worshiped in cold regions, it is unpopular in hot regions due to its burning body. Volcarona is also considered dangerous due to how it scatters hot burning scales, which can rob the surrounding air of its oxygen.\nSlither Wing and Iron Moth bear a resemblance to Volcarona. Slither Wing is believed to be a revived ancestor of Volcarona. Iron Moth is believed to be Volcarona's descendant, possibly a UFO being controlled by alien life for observation.\nVolcarona and its Paradox Pok\u00e9mon counterpart, Iron Moth are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Fiery Dance .\nTwo special Volcarona are worshiped in Lental for being two of the seven guardian Illumina Pok\u00e9mon .

Its face is beige with orange eyes and a short snout. On top of its head are several short spikes. Down its back are two brown ridges that join just past its shoulders. There are two orange protrusions on its shoulders. The bands around its legs are the same color as its face, and it has black hooves underneath these bands. Its striped underside is also beige. It has a short, stubby tail.\nTerrakion fought alongside the other Swords of Justice during a war with humans in order to protect Pok\u00e9mon. Terrakion is said to possess phenomenal strength; it can destroy a castle wall with one blow. Should a small Pok\u00e9mon be bullied by anyone or anything, Terrakion will crush them without mercy. Terrakion loves Terrakion Treats made by Snacksworth , who once sat and enjoyed some snacks with it in the past. Iron Boulder shares a resemblance to Terrakion. Iron Boulder is believed to be a futuristic Terrakion that was modified by a villainous organization .\nIn Generation V , Sacred Sword was its signature move .",

A long, voluminous wispy mane streams out from the upper side of the snout and outwards from its head. The top of this mane is adorned with two protrusions resembling ears. Reshiram's face is fringed with spiky features, and it has a small, pointed extension below the chin. Its eyes have blue irises and black pupils. There are two pairs of pointed teeth visible when its mouth is open, one in the upper jaw and one in the lower. Reshiram has a long and slender neck, with a fluffy, collar-like protrusion jutting out of two gray, glass-like neckbands. Its arms begin slender and arm-like but then flare into a more wing-like appearance, sporting four claws resembling hands on the leading edge. There are plates at the back of Reshiram's \"hands\", that sport a similar color to its neck rings. Reshiram has a feathered or furry feature on its chest, with the lower portion protruding outwards to a point. Long feather-like protrusions jut out of its thighs. On its feet are large gray claws, three at the front and one positioned at the back, resembling high heels. Reshiram's tail is a mass of plume and ribbon-like extensions, surrounded by two large bands, similar to the ones around its neck. When its emotions surge, it enters Overdrive mode , and its tail lights up with a fiery glow.\nReshiram has a jet engine-like tail, which it uses to accelerate itself when flying at high speeds. It can send flames from its tail into the air to incinerate everything around it. By flaring its tail, Reshiram can move the world's atmosphere and change the weather. This tail generator is also activated when influenced by either Zekrom 's signature moves , which in turn powers up Reshiram's. Reshiram loves Reshiram Treats made by Snacksworth , who once encountered it in the past.\nIn Unovan mythology, Reshiram was created from a single Dragon Pok\u00e9mon owned by the twin heroes when it split into two: Reshiram and Zekrom. It sided with the older brother who sought the truth, as a result, it firmly believes in truth. Reshiram is said to be Zekrom's equal in battle, meaning neither of the two dragons can truly defeat the other. It is powerful enough to destroy the region it resides in with its fire powers. Reshiram will transform into the Light Stone should its body get destroyed or when attacked by Kyurem 's tendril-like appendages. It can willingly transform back from said stone when awakened by a hero who believes in truth. According to one myth, Reshiram is said to burn down kingdoms of people who ignore truth due to being consumed by greed.\nReshiram is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Blue Flare by leveling up. Additionaly Reshiram and White Kyurem are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Fusion Flare by leveling up.

It has red sclerae, white irises, and black pupils, as well as a small horn-like protrusion on the tip of its snout. Its head sports a thundercloud-like crest tipped with light-blue coloration. There are six pairs of pointed teeth visible when its mouth is open, two in the upper jaw and four in the lower. At the base of its neck is a black, stud-like feature, and atop its shoulders are similar, larger features resembling armor padding. The bases of its wings also have such padding, and a fanned, splayed, seemingly webbed shape with a small \"wing-spike\" on one edge. The lower lengths of Zekrom's arms extenuate into splayed, seemingly webbed, somewhat baseball-mitt-like formations, with three-clawed, dark-colored hands on the undersides. The front portion of Zekrom's waist is black-colored, with its belly and thighs having thin striations down their length. Its knees are black, as are the foremost parts of its three-clawed feet and spiked heels. When its emotions surge, it enters Overdrive mode , and its tail lights up with a blue light.\nZekrom's tail consists of a large, round, conical, and spiked formation, likened to an electricity generator, with a black inner portion and bands on the tip of the outside portion. This tail produces energy for its attacks and emits an anti-gravity field, allowing Zekrom to fly through the air with minimal effects from aerodynamic resistance and gravity. This tail generator is also activated when influenced by either Reshiram 's signature moves , which in turn powers up Zekrom's. It can cause several thunderstorms in one area, and it normally hides in thunderclouds. Zekrom loves Zekrom Treats made by Snacksworth , who once encountered it in the past.\nIn Unovan mythology, Zekrom was created from a single Dragon Pok\u00e9mon owned by the twin heroes when it split into two: Zekrom and Reshiram. It sided with the younger brother who sought ideals; as a result, it firmly believes in ideals. Zekrom is said to be Reshiram's equal in battle, meaning neither of the two dragons can truly defeat the other. It is powerful enough to destroy the region it resides in with its lightning powers. Zekrom will transform into the Dark Stone should its body get destroyed or when attacked by Kyurem 's tendril-like appendages. Zekrom can willingly transform itself back from said stone when awakened by a hero who believes in ideals. According to one myth, Zekrom uses its lightning to annihilate kingdoms of people who have lost the righteousness in their hearts.\nZekrom is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Bolt Strike by leveling up.

On its forehead are three, sharp, pink horns arranged in a slight, upwards arch. Landorus has white hair shaped like a short log on top of its head, a jagged white mustache, and two pointed orange ears on either side of its head. Its eyes are yellow with beady white irises and no visible pupils. The front of Landorus's body is covered in dark pink spots, most of them shaped like diamonds, pebbles, and magatamas. Its broad chest consists of two joined diamond-shaped pectorals, its shoulders and elbows are adorned with magatama shapes, and on top of its navel is a teardrop, all colored dark pink. It has two spotted muscular arms, with five fingers on each hand. Its lower body consists of a trailing cloud, with a long, curling, brown branch or root-like tail. Landorus's tail has various flat protrusions running its span, each spotted in dark pink on its edge surface. Landorus is considered the 'Guardian of the Fields', due to helping crops grow. Its tail causes the soil to gain nutrition. The energy from the tail is created by combining lightning and wind. It can also create powerful sandstorms on the few occasions it does fight. Landorus seems to live above the skies. Sometimes it stops on the Abundant Shrine in the Unova region or the Hisui region, but only when Tornadus and Thundurus are in the same place. In Hisui, it also tends to resides on islands surrounded by water. Landorus can also stop and calm the two forces of nature whenever the two fight or cause destruction, thus being referred to by the grateful people as 'Great Landorus'. In Hisui, it had the title of god of fields due to it bringing life to the region along with Enamorus. Landorus is permanently in its Incarnate Forme while living in a region. It can unleash mini sandy whirlwinds along with surrounding itself with a wind shield to protect itself from harm. Landorus is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Sandsear Storm.",

            "description": "Kyurem is a gray and blue, bipedal Pok\u00e9mon of indefinable but seemingly draconic basis. Kyurem has a blue head and snout and has yellow eyes without pupils, a pair of pointed light bluish horns on its head, and a yellow crest on its skull that is bioluminescent. Three pointed teeth jut out the bottom of either side of its jaws, which are frozen shut by the ice covering its head. Its long, gray neck has lines running around its whole body, legs, arms, and tail. It has two arms, each with its claw, and each arm is joined by its oddly shaped blue wings, which are believed to be used for flying and storing cold air. Each wing has two spikes of ice that are also bioluminescent. The ice covering the wings can break, revealing gray tendril-like appendages on Kyurem's back. The right side of its body seems to be damaged in some way, as the wing and horn on its head on that side are shorter; the right side of its head also has a spiked edge near its jaw hinge that is absent from its left. Its legs are somewhat slender and have three sharp ice-like claws on each enormous foot. Its tail has three blue conical spikes on its tip, and appears to be some sort of propulsion device or a container of energy; exactly what it is based on is unclear, but it may be a damaged turbine.\nKyurem generates powerful, freezing energy inside itself, but its body becomes frozen when the energy leaks out. It appears that this Pok\u00e9mon uses its ice powers to freeze its own body in order to stabilize its cellular structure. It is said to have a power that exceeds that of Reshiram and Zekrom , however, this power is kept at bay by the extreme cold. Kyurem can use its tendril-like appendages to transform Reshiram and Zekrom back into their respective Dragon Stones and even absofuse with them while they're in that state. In Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , similarly to Reshiram and Zekrom, Kyurem is somehow capable of flying even with its frozen wings. According to the Village of Dragons 's Elder in Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice , Kyurem is considered one of the strongest Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon in the world. Kyurem is powerful enough to cover a city and even an entire region in which it resides in ice. Kyurem loves Kyurem Treats made by Snacksworth , who once encountered it in the past.\nAccording to an old legend in Lacunosa Town , Kyurem is an extraterrestrial Pok\u00e9mon that crashlanded on the planet inside either an icy meteor or a Dragon Stone , creating the Giant Chasm . This same legend describes Kyurem as hostile towards Pok\u00e9mon and humans, due to the fact it supposedly devoured them if they were found outside of Lacunosa Town during the night. However, according to another old legend told by Drayden , Kyurem was created by the leftovers of the the single powerful Dragon Pok\u00e9mon owned by the twin heroes of Unova after it split up into Reshiram and Zekrom. Its true origin is unknown.\nKyurem is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Glaciate by leveling up.",

It has a large, feathery red mane, long, dark blue, ridged eyebrow-like protrusions, and a single cream-colored horn that curves slightly. The back of its head, as well as its neck, is covered with fluffy, light blue fur. Keldeo has blue hooves placed backwards, which are capable of ejecting water. Its tail is light blue with white spots and resembles an elaborate feather in a cap. Long ago, a fire started in the Moor of Icirrus because of a war among people. In this fire, Keldeo was separated from its parents, but together, Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion took care of Keldeo. They acted as its parents, and they taught it knowledge and moves for survival. Keldeo eventually grew and even surpassed the three Pok\u00e9mon. One day, Keldeo took off from the forest with no one knowing why. When the four met again, they taught Keldeo the move Secret Sword. Keldeo was trained by the other members of the Swords of Justice. Keldeo tends to cross the world and often appears at beautiful watersides. Keldeo also travels in order to further improve itself through training. It can walk across the water by ejecting water from its hooves. In Generation V, Sacred Sword was one of its signature moves. Keldeo is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Secret Sword.",

It has a jewel on its forehead and a black headpiece that seems to be shaped like a treble clef, which doubles as an attached microphone such as one often used by singers. Its ovular head seems to be a third of its body's height and about half its height in width. In its Aria Forme, Meloetta has light blue eyes and flowing, wavy hair with light-blue ovals that resemble whole notes. In its Pirouette Forme, it has auburn hair that seems to be stylized in a high bun and red eyes. In both forms, its midriff and eyes match its hair. It is a gender-unknown species. According to artists in Unova, Meloetta's beautiful music and dance inspired many works of art, music, and songs. This made the Pok\u00e9mon popular among both musicians and dancers. Meloetta's melody has a special vocalization method. Meloetta's melody can control the feelings of those who hear it. It can make both humans and Pok\u00e9mon feel happy or sad through this method. The song can also unseal ancient ruins such as the Abyssal Ruins At one point, Meloetta can lose its signature melody and ability to dance should the world be filled with sorrow. Meloetta is capable of flying. Like many other Legendary and Mythical Pok\u00e9mon, Meloetta is capable of temporarily turning invisible. Meloetta's song can be channeled to summon and control the original three forces of nature Pok\u00e9mon in connection with the Reveal Glass. However, this process can cause Meloetta agonizing pain in the process.",

It has two large red eyes that are capable of glowing, and a small white part that could be either its mouth or a vent. It has thin arms with overlapping segments. Each arm ends with a single, pointed claw from which it can spin a sticky string to create structures. There is a gray circle on each shoulder and a gray band around its abdomen. Its segmented legs each end with a large, upward-curving claw.\nGenesect was revived from a Fossil and technologically enhanced by Team Plasma to create the most powerful Pok\u00e9mon ever. N had the project canceled and the P2 Laboratory closed because he felt that Pok\u00e9mon, who he thought to be perfect beings, would lose their beauty if modified by science. However, Scientist Dudley kept working on it, angry that N denied his talent. This scientist reconstructed Genesect and installed the cannon on its back. According to a Hiker in Ambrette Town 's Fossil Lab, there is a rumor that Genesect can be found in Glittering Cave .\nBy folding up its limbs and connecting its head to the cannon on its back, Genesect can assume a flying saucer-like configuration, allowing it to fly. This configuration is known in Japanese as the \u9ad8\u901f\u98db\u884c\u5f62\u614b high-speed flight configuration . As seen in Genesect and the Legend Awakened , Genesect can breathe in outer space.",

Covering its back is a tough, green shell, which extends from its head to halfway down its tail. The tip of its tapered tail is orange. There is a small, off-center hole in the shell on the back of Chespin's head and, around the face, the shell has four leaf-like spikes. On the back of its head is another spike split into three parts.\nChespin's shell can protect it from powerful attacks. The quills on its head are usually soft but can be stiffened for attacking as well. Despite having a curious nature that tends to get it in trouble, Chespin keeps an optimistic outlook and does not worry about small details. By consuming tons of berries , the bark shell that covers Chespin\u2019s head and body will grow sturdier. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy .\nPrior to Generation VII , Chespin and its evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Bulletproof as an Ability .",

            "description": "Quilladin is a bipedal, mammalian Pok\u00e9mon with some plantlike features. Most of its body is covered by a green, armor-like shell similar to a chestnut . The shell covers everything except its face, lower body and legs, and the undersides of its arms. The visible parts of its body are dark brown, except for its lighter face. The face has dark, oval eyes, a small, pink nose on a pointed snout, a dark brown, sideways triangle on each cheek, rodent-like incisors, and a three-pointed patch of dark brown fur on its forehead. On either side of its head is a large, ear-like spike with reddish tips. Its tail also has a reddish tip. Its shell is banded over its arms and on its back, and the fur on its lower body creates a three-pointed pattern on its front. Quilladin has three white, clawed digits on its hands and two on its feet.\nQuilladin is not aggressive and never starts fights, although it is known to exercise its lower body by running into other Quilladin. When it is forced to defend itself, it relies on its shell to deflect attacks, before counterattacking with its sharp quills. The shell of Quilladin is both sturdy and heavy, which naturally strengthens the lower body of Quilladin. A Quilladin's tackle is powerful enough to send a trailer flying. Due to this body, Quilladin is immune to pain, not even violent collisions will faze it.\nBefore Generation VII , Quilladin and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Bulletproof as an Ability .",

It has a small, pink nose with a three-pointed patch of brown fur extending up its short snout and four pointed teeth. On top of its head is a plate of beige armor, similar to a helmet. It possesses a prominent domed, armor-like shell similar to that of a chestnut. The armor is beige with four large spines jutting out of the back. The armor is trimmed with red and green bands; the green is on the outermost edge. There is an additional spine protruding from the armor over each of Chesnaught's shoulders, which are connected by a green breastplate. Its body is colored similarly to the shell, and its long limbs and tail are banded with plates of armor. The top surfaces of the tail and arms are protected by green armor, and each arm has two small spines. It has three brown, clawed digits on its hands and feet. Its arms can be brought together to create a spike-covered \"shield\".\nChesnaught is renowned for its tank-like body; it is capable of flipping a 50-ton truck. Once it gets into its defensive stance with its hands covering its face, it can stand up to a bomb's explosion. It will not hesitate to use its sturdy body to shield its allies from danger. While Chesnaught is normally gentle and prefers avoiding conflict, it will not hesitate to give opponents a thrashing with its thorned fists when the situation calls for it.\nBefore Generation VII , Chesnaught and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Bulletproof as an Ability .",

Tufts of dark orange fur cover the interior of its large ears. Fennekin also has small paws with no visible toes and slim legs. Its tail is fluffy with a dark orange tip.\nHot air is vented from Fennekin's ears, reaching temperatures of over 390 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius). It uses this ability to intimidate opponents. Fennekin chews on twigs, which fill it with energy. It can be temperamental, but it tries to do its best for its Trainer .

The fur on its cheeks is longer, and a small mane of white fur covers its shoulders and chest. Long, wavy tufts of dark orange fur grow out of its large ears, and its eyes and small nose match this fur in color. When its mouth is open, two pointed teeth can be seen in its upper jaw. Above its developed legs, the fur around its hips sweeps out to either side, resembling a skirt or shorts. Each paw has three small digits.\nBraixen always keeps a stick in its tail, which it sets alight using friction from its bushy tail fur. The flame from the lit twig is used for both attack and communication. It draws circles in the air with the flame to indicate danger.",

This \"robe\" is primarily dark red with red-orange, flame-like markings near its knees. There is also a thin tuft of white fur on its torso, which is flanked by yellow fur draping down from its shoulders. Its forearms feature long red fur resembling sleeves, and its hands and feet are dark gray with three clawed fingers and toes, respectively. A tail covered in yellow fur protrudes from its \"robe\". Its head is yellow with longer white fur on its cheeks. It has red eyes and a slender snout with a pinkish nose. Three tufts of red-orange fur protrude out of each ear. When its mouth is open, two pointed teeth can be seen on its upper jaw.\nDelphox carries a stick that it uses like a magic wand. When in use, the tip is set alight, and when not in use, the stick is hidden away in its sleeve-like fur. Delphox gazes into the flame at the tip of its wand to achieve a focused state of mind that allows it to see into the future. It can use its psychic power to ensnare its enemies in a fiery vortex capable of reaching 5,400 degrees Fahrenheit (3,000 degrees Celsius). Delphox uses the stick to leave burn marks on the ground. In ancient times, people used the shapes of Delphox's burn marks for divination.",

Froakie produces a large mane of bubbles from its chest and back and has two small bubbles on its nose.\nThe delicate yet flexible bubbles, called Frubbles (Japanese: \u30b1\u30ed\u30e0\u30fc\u30b9 Keromousse ), reduce the damage Froakie takes from attacks. Despite its carefree attitude, it is vigilant of its surroundings. Froakie uses a happy-go-lucky look as an act to trick its enemies. It will suddenly drop the facade without warning and overwhelm its foes with its blinding speed. Froakie is both light and strong, making it capable of jumping incredibly high. Upon jumping high, it will throw springy bubbles at the heads of foes. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy .",

It has a white bubble scarf, dark blue hands and circular toes, and white circular fingers.\nFrogadier is a nimble and swift Pok\u00e9mon; it can scale a tower exceeding 2,000 feet (600 meters) in one minute. It can also throw bubble-coated pebbles at targets up to 100 feet (30 meters) away. The reason for this is due to the tips of its fingers and toes allowing it to stick firmly onto vertical surfaces. It can confound opponents by leaping about ceilings or into trees. Frogadier is an expert on creating battle strategies that make use of the terrain. Due to this, it will never miss its mark when throwing bubble-covered pebbles.",

It is mostly dark blue with a yellow chest, a white triangular marking over each eye, a light blue four-pointed star on each thigh, and yellow on the lower half of its face. It has red eyes with white pupils and its mouth is hidden behind a large, pink tongue that wraps around its neck and extends outward behind its head. Running down the middle of its head is a fin-like extension, and there is a similar fin on each side of its head. Light blue webbing connects its head fins. There is a large, white bubble-like bump on each elbow and knee. Its back feet have two toes, while its front feet have three toes. Each digit has a bulbous tip and yellow webbing.\nGreninja's movements are swift, rapid and graceful, akin to those of ninja. It uses this speed to confound enemies while slicing them up. It can compress water into various weapons to slice up enemies, most commonly in the form of its Water Shuriken , though it has been shown creating water katana and water kunai in both the anime and the Super Smash Bros. series. It can also create shuriken from the mucus it excretes from its thighs for sharp projectiles that can split through metal. Although this is only seen in the anime, Greninja's tongue is extremely long and many times its own height, and strong enough to catch and hold an average human. However, it usually keeps its tongue wrapped around its neck like a scarf. Doing so exposes its tongue to air movements, allowing Greninja to detect enemies it otherwise could not see.\nIn Generation VI , Mat Block was its signature move . In Generation IX , Water Shuriken is its signature move.",

Its most notable feature is its two ears, which resemble muscular forearms, complete with three-fingered paws. The ears are mostly gray with pink interiors, whereas the paws at the tips are brown. There are three brown spots above each ear-paw. A pointed protrusion in the middle resembles an elbow. These ears are as powerful as an excavator, being strong enough to lift objects weighing over a ton and reduce dense bedrock to rubble, and prove to be an invaluable asset in Diggersby's digging.\nDiggersby's remaining limbs are small in comparison to the ears. The fur of the upper paws is white, while the feet are brown; each paw has three digits. A sash or belt-like band composed of thicker, woolly fur surrounds its waist; it tends to tuck its paws into this fur. This fur is known to retain heat exceptionally well and was used by people for heavy winter clothing. This sash is divided into sections: brown on its sides and yellow on the front and back. Its short tail is also yellow and protrudes from the back section of the sash. Diggersby's face has a large brown muzzle with prominent cheeks. The coloration around its muzzle extends down onto its neck and resembles beard stubble. It has two large upper incisors, three whiskers on each cheek, a tiny, pink nose, and eyes that appear to perpetually squint.\nDiggersby's digging skills make it a huge help at construction sites, especially with tunnel work. When it is finished digging, it lounges lazily.",

            "description": "Fletchling is a small, avian Pok\u00e9mon similar in appearance to a robin . It has a reddish-orange head with a triangular yellow mark on the back of each eye. Its body and wings are gray, and there are white tips on the wings. It has a long, black tail with a white V-shaped marking near the tip. The tail ends in two points and has two feathers sticking out at the base, resembling the fletching on the end of an arrow. Its legs, small beak, and eyes are black. The legs are thin and spindly, with two toes facing forward and one facing backward on each foot.\nFletchling is said to be very friendly and is well known for its beautiful songs, which are in fact sounds of warning. It communicates by using chirps and moving its tailfeathers to signal others of its kind. In spite of its typically peaceful disposition, it is relentless in battle and very territorial, attacking perceived threats mercilessly. Its body is warm and doubles in temperature when startled or excited. This increase in temperature spikes hormone production in its body. It can burn someone if they touch it with their bare hands. Fletchling live in both rural and urban areas, and once had massive territorial fights with Squawkabilly in the Paldea region.\nFletchling and its evolutions are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Gale Wings as an Ability .",

It has a sharp, black beak, black eyes with yellow, mask-like markings behind them, and a small, pointed crest on the back of its head. Its upper side is reddish-orange and its belly is gray. There is a flame pattern on its breast where the two colors meet. The tips and undersides of its pointed, black wings are yellow. Its legs are also black with sharp talons and two toes facing forward and one back. Two white, V-shaped markings are located near the tip of its long black tail-feathers. Its tail ends in two points and has another feather sticking out of the base on each side, resembling the fletching on the end of an arrow.\nFletchinder has a flame sac in its belly. It hunts by igniting tall grass and swooping down on bug Pok\u00e9mon that attempt to escape the blaze. Once captured, the prey is cooked before being consumed. As its internal fire gradually heats up, it can fly at increasingly faster speeds. It is aggressive and territorial, even against its own kind. It often fights with its own kind for the right to feeding grounds. Its territory range has a radius of over one mile, or around 2-3 km.\nFletchinder and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Gale Wings as an Ability .",

Its underside and hindquarters are gray and the tips of its long, pointed wings are black. Orange spots speckle its underside. Large yellow talons extend from the shaggy feathers on its legs. Talonflame has a pointed crest atop its head and black-and-yellow mask-like markings around its eyes. Its black beak is hooked with a yellow cere . It also has long black tailfeathers marked with three yellow V-shapes. The tail ends in two points and has another feather sticking out of the base on each side, resembling of the fletching on the end of an arrow.\nTalonflame feeds on other bird Pok\u00e9mon, such as Wingull and Pikipek . It hunts by diving and attacking its prey with kicks before grasping them with its talons, ensuring they have no time to escape from it. When it dives, it can reach speeds of 310 miles per hour (500 kilometers per hour). It is powerful enough to be able to fly while carrying prey weighing more than 220 lbs (100 kg). It showers embers from the gaps in its feathers as it soars through the sky in order to intimidate its foes. Its wings are fireproof and have been used to make firefighter outfits in the past.\nTalonflame and its pre-evolutions are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Gale Wings as an Ability .",

Scatterbug has a three-segmented body with a pair of nubby, beige legs on each segment. A white ruff of fur encircles its neck, and there is a large beige spot on its rear.\nScatterbug eats various types of plants, including poisonous leaves and roots. The poison it ingests is processed and turned into a black powder that it scatters all over its body. This powder causes paralysis on contact, and allows Scatterbug to deter bird Pok\u00e9mon from attacking. The powder also regulates Scatterbug's temperature, allowing it to adapt to any climate. Grafaiai is a natural predator of Scatterbug. [1]",

It has a rounded muzzle with a dark brown nose, round ears with dark brown interiors, bright blue eyes, and a dark brown stripe behind each eye. The fur around its thighs is longer and each paw has three toes. There is a tuft of longer fur on the tip of its tail. A male Pyroar has a large, predominantly red mane with gold streaks forming a pattern resembling the Daimonji symbol (\u5927) and the symbol for fire (\u706b). In contrast, a female has a long, gold and red crest-like mane extending from its forehead. Female Pyroar significantly outnumber their male counterparts. The female's mane is as long as its whole body, and the light brown on its front legs extends all the way to its shoulders. The light brown fur on the male's front legs only extends up to its elbows.\nLike real-life lions, Pyroar live in prides, which are led by the male with the largest mane. The pride's females protect the Litleo cubs and teach them how to hunt. The females also work together to bring down prey, ensuring the pride never goes hungry. A male Pyroar is usually lazy, but will protect its friends at the risk of its own well-being. In battle, the male Pyroar's mane can heat up to over 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit (2,000 degrees Celsius), which can cause severe burns when approached. Pyroar viciously threatens any challenger with a fiery breath exceeding 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (6,000 degrees Celsius). However, it prefers its meat raw and does not use its breath on its prey. Pyroar typically lives in grassy plains and mountainsides.\nPrior to Generation VII , Pyroar and its pre-evolved form, Litleo, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Noble Roar .",

It has beady eyes, a pink blush mark on each cheek, long, notched ears, and a small, pointed nose. On top of its head are several spheres of pollen that form a crown. It has stubby arms and a tail, but no visible legs. Flab\u00e9b\u00e9 is a female-only species with no male counterpart. It is one of the shortest and lightest Pok\u00e9mon in existence.\nFlab\u00e9b\u00e9 is usually seen holding the yellow stigma of a flower, called a \u201cFairy Flower\u201d in the anime . The flower has three stamens and rounded petals that can be red, yellow, orange, blue, or white. It also has a short green stem with three small leaves. Its crown is made from the flower's pollen, which has healing properties. Flab\u00e9b\u00e9 can control and draw power out of the flower but is unsafe without it. However, it will continue searching until it finds a flower that it likes. Once it does, Flab\u00e9b\u00e9 will spend the rest of its life taking care of that flower. The anime has shown that if one of the petals on a Flab\u00e9b\u00e9's flower falls off, it will be unable to float around.\nPrior to Generation VII , Flab\u00e9b\u00e9 and its evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Flower Veil and Symbiosis as Abilities .",

It is a female-only species with no male counterpart.\nFloette also holds a flower with five rounded petals that can be red, yellow, orange, blue, or white. The flower has three yellow stamens and a long green stem with a single leaf. The more gorgeous the flower, the more power that it contains for Floette to use. Floette is unable to use moves by itself, but when it synchronizes with flowers, it becomes able to use Grass-type moves , with White Flower Floette being capable of easily synchronizing with flowers of other colors. Floette can restore withered flowers to perfect health by drawing forth what power is left in them. It can also draw forth the latent capabilities of Grass types. It flutters around and cares for withered flowers by giving its own power to them. If the flowers of a well-tended flower bed bloom, Floette celebrates with an elegant dance. However, it will never forgive anyone who tramples a flowerbed and will attack them mercilessly.\nPrior to Generation VII , Floette and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Flower Veil and Symbiosis as Abilities .",

Its lower body resembles a mermaid's tail with two large leaves sprouting above the tailfin. It is a female-only species with no male counterpart.\nFlorges can live for several hundred years and devotes its life to protecting gardens. It claims beautiful flower gardens as its territory and can control the flowers it grows. It also gains power by basking in the energy emitted by flowering plants. A Florges's flower garden is said to contain healing properties for both body and spirit. In the past, it was asked to create flower gardens for castles. Because of this, Florges was popular with castle governors. Florges can live for up to several hundred years, over the course of which it will spend protecting gardens. While Florges can be compassionate, it will hunt down anyone who vandalizes the flower garden it takes care of, punishing them without mercy, even if said person begs for it. It can fire beams similar to batteries of artillery .\nPrior to Generation VII , Florges and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Flower Veil and Symbiosis as Abilities .",

There is a leafy green mane around its neck that extends along its back. The mane ends at its tail, which is made up of three short leaves.\nSkiddo can perform photosynthesis with the leaves on its back, which means that it does not need to eat so long as it has sunshine and water. It has a docile nature and is thought to be one of the first Pok\u00e9mon to live alongside humans, who ride on it to travel across mountains. As seen in the anime , milk from Skiddo can be used to make dairy products.\nSkiddo and its evolution, Gogoat , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Grass Pelt as an Ability .",

It is covered in shaggy, brown fur that is darker across the back and lighter around the belly and legs. Around its neck is a thick, green leafy mane that extends down its back and ends in a short, bushy tail. The fur on its legs is shorter than the rest of its body; it is dark brown on the upper leg and white around the feet. Each foot ends in a cloven, brownish-orange hoof.\nGogoat has been domesticated by people since 5,000 years ago, and is often used for transport. Gogoat is known to have empathic abilities that allow them to sense the feelings of whoever grips its horns. It does this by sensing subtle changes to the grip, and this ability is so acute that it can move as if it and its rider were one being. In the wild, Gogoat lives in herds in mountainous regions. The leader of the herd is decided through battles with its horns.\nGogoat and its pre-evolved form, Skiddo , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Grass Pelt as an Ability .

Its head and belly are covered in thick white fur, while its lower body, chest, arms, and back are covered in equally thick dark gray fur. A long cape of this dark gray fur hangs down behind its back; in combination with the rest of the dark-furred pattern, this gives the impression that Pangoro is wearing a long coat and trousers. Pangoro's three-fingered paws have shorter, darker fur and are tipped with black claws. It has a blunt snout with a triangular black nose, rounded black ears, prominent fangs in its lower jaw, and black semicircles under its brow that make its eyes indistinguishable. Pangoro likes to carry a thin-stemmed shoot with two leaves in its mouth. This small bamboo shoot is used to sense the movements of those around it.\nDespite its cantankerous demeanor, Pangoro is kind to those it considers to be its friends and it does not tolerate those who pick on the weak. With arms powerful enough to snap a telephone pole, it charges into battle like a berserker, heedless of any damage it might suffer. Pangoro can destroy a dump truck in one punch and utilizes this strength when pummeling its opponents. Many Trainers find themselves smitten with its lively nature; however, those who wish to train a Pangoro for themselves will have to fight one. It lives to engage in duels with Obstagoon .\nPrior to Generation VII , Pangoro and its pre-evolved form, Pancham, were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Parting Shot .",

This psychic energy can send even a wrestler flying. While its blank expression barely changes, beneath it is an intense struggle, trying so hard to control its psychic powers.

Both genders have two tails, folded ears, a small collar of fur around the neck, and a tuft of fur on top of the head. On the inner surface of the tips of each ear, there is an eye-like organ with a ring at its center. This organ can emit psychic energy powerful enough to obliterate a 10-ton truck or tanker into dust. When emitting psychic powers, the organ glows light blue. Meowstic usually keeps its ears folded at all times to keep its psychic powers in check, but it will unleash this power if threatened. The male Meowstic is predominantly dark blue. Its eyes are green with light blue sclerae. The organ in its ears is green with a light blue ring. The tuft of fur between its ears is white and curves slightly to the side and the collar around its neck is white with several stray tufts of fur. It has pointed ears with white at the fold and on the tips of its ears; there is also a white ring near the tips of its ears. Its tails are also pointed with white tips and a white ring near the end. There is a tuft of fur on each hip and it has white paws. Male Meowstic have a strong defensive instinct, as it prefers to support its allies rather than attack, despite having powerful psychic powers to blast away any opponent. They are willing to use their full power to protect themselves or their partners. When a male Meowstic continues to emit its powerful psychic energy, it will damage its body as a side effect. The female Meowstic is predominantly white. Its ears have no markings and curled tips and its eyes are red with yellow sclerae. The organ in its ears is red with a yellow ring. The tuft of fur on its head is blue and curled, as is the collar around its neck. Its tails are blue at the base and end in white, fluffy curls. There are blue, stocking-like markings around its paws and two tufts of fur on each hip. Female Meowstic are known to be more selfish, aggressive, and aversive than their male counterparts. Should the female Meowstic not get what it wants, it will torment anyone with its psychic abilities. Female Meowstic generally have a stoic expression even when using their psychic powers. When they sense danger, they will unleash their psychic power at its maximum strength, with no regard for their opponents.",

Attached to the pommel is a long, dark blue cloth with a swirl design in lighter blue at the tip; the tip of the sash splits into four tassels. Honedge's sheath is dark brown with curved lines resembling a triquetra across its surface. Near the top of the sheath are two rings and a hole that in conjunction with the shape of Honedge's blade create the illusion of a face, with eyes and a mouth. A third ring extends onto the hilt and encircles its actual eye.\nHonedge is said to have been born from a person's soul after they were killed by the sword that it resides in. Its sash is prehensile, and it holds its sheath with it when battling. Honedge is known to wrap its sash on people's arms and suck their life energy if they dare to grab it by the hilt.",

            "description": "Doublade is a Pok\u00e9mon composed of two swords. Each sword has a silver blade and a light gray hilt. Embedded in each hilt is a single, pink gem with a dark center that appears to be an eye. Attached to each pummel is a long, dark purple sash with a pink swirl pattern on the tip; the tip of the sashes split into four tassels. Doublade has two sheathes that are attached to a plaque. The sheathes are varying shades of brown with lines forming a triquetra pattern across the front. Near the top of each sheath are white teeth-like markings and rings with white centers that resemble eyes. A third ring extends onto the hilt and encircles the actual eye.\nDoublade excels in both defensive and offensive strategies. Doublade's two swords are able to communicate telepathically, and they use this ability to carry out complex attacks that are unstoppable even by those skilled at swordplay. When rubbing its two blades together, Doublade can emit a metallic sound that is unnerving to the opponents.",

Where the blade meets the hilt is a single, purple eye with a white slit pupil surrounded by black space. The handle forms a thick, striated spike. Two cloth-like arms emerge from the sides of the hilt. Each arm is primarily black and transitions to a pale purple with a slight swirl pattern at the tip. The sash-like arms split into four tassels at the tips. It always carries an ornate shield in at least one of its arms. The shield is gold and has three brown rings surrounded by black in the middle. It also has a brown rim with three lines radiating toward the center. Aegislash possesses incredible spectral powers, enabling it to manipulate people and Pok\u00e9mon alike. It is also able to detect the innate qualities of leadership; legend has it that whoever it recognizes as a worthy leader is destined to become king. In fact, this Pok\u00e9mon has attended and served generations of kings. However, an Aegislash was rumored to have drained the life of one king, causing his kingdom to fall alongside him. Aegislash is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move King's Shield.",

Its eyes are black with red sclerae and pupils and full black lashes. It has two wavy ears or tufts with yellow centers on its head. Each of its hands has three yellow claws, and it has paw-like feet with three toes.\nAromatisse can give off a variety of different smells, ranging from a pleasant fragrance to bolster its allies to an odor so repugnant that its opponent loses the will to fight. The scent emitted by its pink fur is so strong that its companions and Trainer will gradually lose the ability to smell. In Generation VI , Aromatic Mist was its signature move . Additionally, prior to Generation VIII , Aromatisse and its pre-evolved form, Spritzee , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Aroma Veil as an Ability .",

When its mouth is open, two upper fangs can be seen. In between its ears is a more prominent tuft of fur. Poking out of the bottom of its fur is its light pink tail. Although Swirlix is typically depicted as levitating to move about, it has a pair of rear paws tucked up in its fur; when exposed, these paws appear to be light pink and have three toes each.\nSwirlix only eats sweets, which makes its fur as sticky as cotton candy. Its fur is said to smell like cotton candy. It can entangle its opponents with white sticky thread. The amount of sugar it eats is equal to its weight. It is known to become grumpy if it doesn't eat enough sugar.\nPrior to Generation VII , Swirlix and its evolved form, Slurpuff , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Sweet Veil as an Ability .",

There are four of these luminescent spots on the front and two on the back. Attached to its mantle are two transparent tentacles; its remaining tentacles are part of its main body, eight in total. It has round black eyes and a pink beak-like mouth.\nInkay can cause its luminescent spots to blink and flash; this behavior serves a variety of uses. If Inkay is threatened, the blinking lights will cause its opponents to become dazed and lose their will to battle, allowing it to escape. The blinking also serves to attract Inkay's prey, which is then ensnared and held in place by its tentacles. Inkay also uses various complex rhythms and patterns of lights to communicate to others of its kind. Because of this, Inkay instinctively reacts to anything in its habitat that emits light or echoing sounds. By floating upside-down, Inkay improves its blood flow along with clearing its head. This also drastically boosts the power of Inkay's Psychic moves and is what triggers its evolution into Malamar .\nPrior to Generation VIII and in Generation IX , Inkay and its evolved form, Malamar, are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Topsy-Turvy .",

            "description": "Malamar is a Pok\u00e9mon that resembles an upside-down squid. Several purple tentacles with bright blue undersides sprout from the top of its head. It has yellow eyes with black sclerae, a dark pink beak-like mouth , and lighter purple eyelids. Its main body is dark purple and has six circular yellow lights on the front and back. There is also a yellow stripe nearly encircling its upper body. Covering its main body is a transparent mantle with two white fins on the bottom that function as legs. On each side of the mantle is a long tentacle with dark pink at the top and white, scythe-like fins at the ends. The edge of Malamar's fins are said to be supremely sharp.\nMalamar possesses strong hypnotic powers, which are said to be the most powerful of any Pok\u00e9mon. Malamar uses its hypnotic power to force others to do its bidding. Those under Malamar's control will lose their memories surrounding the event. People often utilize this ability for nefarious deeds. Malamar's hypnotic powers are said to have played a role in several history-changing events. It lures prey with the flashing pattern on its luminescent body and hypnotic motions, then ensnares them in its tentacles. The prey is then finished off with digestive fluids. Both the anime and the TCG show Malamar living near water or even under water. As shown in Kalos, Where Dreams and Adventures Begin! , it uses its tentacles to propel itself, swimming leg-first.\nPrior to Generation VIII and in Generation IX , Malamar and its pre-evolved form, Inkay, are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Topsy-Turvy .",

Its body is orange with a white band around the middle.\nBinacle is always found as a pair living in a single gray rock, and they need to cooperate with each other in order to survive. It moves by stretching and contracting its bodies and yanking the rock along in a hopping motion. The pair has a tendency of squabbling with one another. When they do, one of them will move and find a different rock with a different Binacle to live alongside with. Binacle eats seaweed that washes up on the shoreline.",

It camouflages itself as the seaweed to hide from enemies while storing power for evolution. It also uses this technique to hide from prey, which it sprays with liquid poison when approached. However, its main source of food is rotten seaweed, which it uses to create its poison. Skrelp is known to coexist well with Dhelmise .",

Its sides are a light purple with slender vertical lines, while most of the rest of its body is a dull brown. There is a light purple patch on its face surrounding its red eyes. It has a tubular, upturned snout and on the back of its head is a thin appendage. On top of its head is a red, leaf-like crest with two brownish-green antennae. On either side of its body is a skinny, leaf-like appendage and its tailfin also resembles a large leaf. There are three small spikes along its back.\nDragalge is a territorial Pok\u00e9mon that will spit poison at whatever trespasses on its territory. Its poison is strong enough to melt the hulls of metal tankers. As a result, it is said that ships sailing through the seas where it lives never return. It hunts by hiding itself in seaweed and then ambushing prey, such as Finizen , with a spray of poisonous liquid. However, it is known to coexist well with Dhelmise . Dragalge can create Dragon energy by absorbing the sunlight through the plume on its head.",

            "description": "Clauncher is a crustacean Pok\u00e9mon that resembles a bright blue shrimp . It has three pairs of light gray legs; two pairs have simple blue spikes, while the foremost pair forms a larger set of claws. One claw forms a single, sharp point; and the other is much larger and forms a more traditional pincer, with a tiny yellow lower claw and a yellow circular pattern with two stripes on the back. Each front claw has a black stripe across the top. It has a pair of yellow antennae on top of its head, yellow eyes, and three pointed mandibles . There are three black stripes along its back that separate its body into segments, and it has a light gray underside. Two black, rectangular fins form its tail.\nClauncher's large claw gives it a poor sense of balance and makes it difficult to swim straight. Instead, it moves by firing compressed water from this claw. This is achieved through controlled expulsions of internal gas. Additionally, it uses this ability to shoot down flying prey and can shatter rock at close range. Occasionally, its claws will fall off, causing it to go into hiding until the claws grow back. The meat inside its claws is said to be delicious; however, it has a characteristic taste that is not universally loved. Clauncher's claws are a popular delicacy in places like Galar and Paldea . Dreepy is known to bite on Clauncher, although it does not actually feed on them; this is said to be a behavior carried over from when it was alive.\nFrom Generation VIII onward, Clauncher and its evolved form, Clawitzer , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Mega Launcher as an Ability .",

Its body is divided into several segments by black ridges and there are three small spikes behind its head. It has semicircular, yellow eyes, a black stripe across its face divided into parts, and four pointed mandibles . Its tail consists of three pointed fins: two black ones and one bright blue one. It lacks legs but has two clawed arms. The left claw is smaller and is dark blue with a black stripe along the back and a yellow tip. The right claw is a pincer larger than Clawitzer's body. The pincer is dark blue with a pair of thin, yellow antennae on top, three overlapping segments with a black stripe along the back edge, and four black spikes attached to the back of the last segment. The movable lower portion of the pincer is yellow, as is the inner portion of the pincer's last segment, which has three stripes patterning it.\nClawitzer are a territorial species, known to fiercely battle against each other. Clawitzer's massive claw can suck up water and launch it as compressed cannonballs capable of piercing tanker hulls. By using the gases inside its body, water can also be expelled from the nozzle on the back, which allows it to travel at speeds of up to 60 knots. The feelers on Clawitzer's claws can detect the location of its prey. The claw itself is packed with meat, which can be used as a cooking ingredient.\nFrom Generation VIII onward, Clawitzer and its pre-evolved form, Clauncher , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Mega Launcher as an Ability .",

On either side of its head hangs a pointed, extension with a yellow tip. These can stiffen and expand into a frill.\nThese frills have cells that generate electricity when exposed to sunlight. This allows it to create its own energy and thrive without food in its desert home. The frills act similar to solar panels and are the source of Helioptile's electric moves. However should this process get interrupted, Helioptile will be stressed to the point of weakness. As seen in one of its attack animations in the games, its head and frills glow with a pale yellow light when it uses certain moves.\nPrior to Generation VIII , Helioptile and its evolved form, Heliolisk , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Electrify .",

Covering its neck is a black frill with orange spikes around the rim. This frill can be raised to frame its head if needed. Its hands and feet are black with three digits each and there is an orange band with triangular markings around each leg. It has a long, tapering tail that is orange and then black at the tip.\nHeliolisk can generate sufficient electricity to power a skyscraper, simply by flaring open its frill. When its frill is flared while it basks in the sun, it can generate enough electricity to power an entire city. This electricity can be used to stimulate its muscles, which boosts the strength in its legs. This allows it to sprint a hundred yards in five seconds, even being capable of running on water without breaking surface tension, as shown in New Pok\u00e9mon Snap and in the TCG . In Galar , there was an old desert culture that highly treasured the Heliolisk due to treasure having arrived with them.\nPrior to Generation VIII , Heliolisk and its pre-evolved form, Helioptile , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Electrify .",

The hind legs are more developed and have rectangular, armor plating over the knees, three white claws on each foot, and a smaller, fourth digit lacking a claw off to the side. Its tail is short with an orange spike near the tip.\nTyrunt has a selfish, spoiled nature. If it encounters something it dislikes, it will throw a violent tantrum and run wild. Its strong jaws have enough force to shred an automobile, and it tends to unknowingly inflict injuries while playing, even on its Trainer.

Several sharp teeth are visible in the lower jaw, while the upper jaw is lined with orange-tipped, tooth-like projections. Over its eyes is a row of five spikes resembling a crown. Around Tyrantrum's neck is a feathery white ruff that extends over its shoulders similar to a cape. Its underbelly is gray with white borders and there are two orange spikes near the tip of its long tail. Its small forelimbs have only two black-clawed digits each, but it has powerful hind legs with three black claws each. Plated, armor-like ridges cover its knees, back, and the top of its tail.\nBefore its extinction 100,000,000 years ago, Tyrantrum was known to be vicious but had the presence of a magnificent king. Its powerful jaws, capable of shredding thick metal plates as easily as paper, made it invincible. Its strength allows it to sleep in the wild entirely unguarded without feeling worried. It is theorized that its original form was completely covered with a feather-like coat. Tyrantrum preys on Amaura .",

            "description": "Aurorus is a quadrupedal, dinosaurian Pok\u00e9mon that resembles a sauropod . It is primarily blue with a light blue underside. It has bright blue eyes, a long neck, and a long, tapering tail with a teardrop-shaped tip. On its head is a V-shaped white marking with a single, light blue crystal in the center. Two large, flowing sails extend from the top of its head and run down the length of its neck. The sails are pale whitish-yellow at the base and fade into a pale bluish-purple at the edges. However, its sails can change color depending on its mood as seen in Pok\u00e9mon-Amie . Running the length of its body on either side is a line of small ice crystals. There are three clawed toes on its hind legs, but one large nail and a single claw on its forelegs.\nAurorus is usually quiet and kind but can create ice walls or encase enemies in ice when enraged. The crystals on its body produce freezing air as cold as \u2212240 degrees Fahrenheit (\u2212150 degrees Celsius). One Aurorus was discovered frozen in a glacier as it looked a long time ago. It is said that when Aurorus howls, several auroras will then appear in the sky.\nFrom Generation VIII onward, Aurorus and its pre-evolved form, Amaura , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Refrigerate as an Ability .",

It has light blue eyes, long ears with blue interiors and thicker fur, a tiny nose, two stray tufts of fur on top of its head, and two pointed teeth which can be seen when it opens its mouth. There are two bows on its body: one at the base of its left ear and one at its neck. Each bow is pale cream with a pink center and trails a pair of ribbon-like feelers. The feelers are pale cream and end at the tips with a pink stripe, then a dark blue stripe, and then a light blue color. The feelers can be manipulated like limbs and extended far beyond their typical length. It has slender legs with small, three-toed paws and a fluffy, slightly curved tail.\nSylveon's ribbon-like feelers emit a soothing aura that erases any sense of hostility, enabling it to stop fights instantly. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Sylveon's soothing aura can allow any nearby Trainers to obtain a good night sleep whenever they go to sleep. When hunting, it swirls its feelers as a distraction while the aura weakens feelings of hostility in its prey, then it pounces on the victim. It will also wrap its feelers around its Trainer 's arm as they walk together, which allows it to read their feelings. When a fight breaks out between Sylveon and Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon, Sylveon will bravely charge at them even if they are much bigger than itself; in Galar , this feat is told as a fairy tale.\nSylveon is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Pixilate as an Ability without the use of Mega Evolution ; in Generation VIII and Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet , it is the only Pok\u00e9mon that can have Pixilate at all.",

It has a blue-green mask-like marking across its face, an orange blaze running from its forehead to the back of its neck, an orange ring around each eye, and a small, red patch at the tip of its beak. There is black space around its eyes, which are yellow with paler yellow sclerae. On the back of its head are two rectangular, tassel-like feathers. Its red, cape-like wings have blue-green undersides and are connected to its feathery tail. Near the tip of each wing is a three-clawed hand. Its front is white with a line of red along its neck and the top of its chest. It has small, yellow feet with three toes each.\nHawlucha makes up for its small body with its proficiency in fighting, which allows it to keep up with bigger fighters such as Machamp and Hariyama . It leaps around to stay in its opponent's blind spots and controls its position in the air by using its wings. A favored tactic is to strike from above because it is a difficult maneuver to defend against. However, Hawlucha has a tendency to show off in the heat of battle; opponents can exploit its vanity to gain the upper hand. In Paldea , Primeape is Hawlucha's natural enemy.\nHawlucha is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Flying Press by leveling up.",

There is a thick black stripe down its back and it has a pale yellow belly. It has stubby limbs with three digits on each paw and a long, thin black tail with a tuft of fur on the tip.\nDedenne's upper whiskers serve as antennae that can send and receive electrical waves. This allows it to communicate with others of its kind over great distances, sharing locations of food or electricity, and sense its surroundings. The simple, lower whiskers are organs that can fire electricity. However, Dedenne is small and its electricity-generating organ is under-developed, making it unable to generate a lot of electricity on its own. It absorbs electricity from other electric Pok\u00e9mon, or from homes and buildings by plugging its tail into outlets; Dedenne are known to live near humans due to this behavior. When it is low on charge, it curls up and sleeps. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Dedenne will occasionally fall asleep while sucking its tail. It is believed that Dedenne does this to how happy it feels from absorbing all that electricity.",

            "description": "Carbink is a gray, rock-like Pok\u00e9mon with a conical body. Its body has light blue crystals of various shapes and sizes embedded in it. A white, fluffy collar surrounds its small head. It uses this soft mane to polish the gems of other Carbink. It has bright blue eyes, a light blue crystal on top of its head, and flat diamond-shaped ears. In some media depictions , the fluffy collar, ears, and pattern of the blue crystals on the Carbink\u2019s body can differ based on size and crystal pattern. Due to its small stature, it ties with Minior and Dwebble as the shortest Rock-type .\nCarbink is born from the high temperatures and pressures underground. Since then, it has slept underground for millions of years. It is also occasionally found during cave excavations. It is known to compare its hard body with those of Geodude and Roggenrola . It is known to be preyed upon by Sableye , and caught by Gabite . Carbink defends itself by shooting high-energy beams from the gem on its head and other parts of its body. Although Carbink are not specially rare, the jewels on its body draw the attention from people. Rarely, Carbink will undergo a strange mutation and transform into the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Diancie . It is said that a pack of Carbink lives with a Diancie queen in a jeweled kingdom deep underground. It's also said that there's a mineral vein housing another, large pack of Carbink with another Diancie queen. Carbink is also one of the few Pok\u00e9mon found in Area Zero Underdepths .",

The lower half of its body is light purple, while the upper half is a paler shade of purple. Along the dividing line of the two colors are five large, green spots. The front part of this line is its mouth. On top of its head are two pairs of antenna-like horns; the hind pair is longer than the front pair. These sensitive horns are used to check its surroundings.\nGoomy is considered the weakest Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon. Its body is mostly water and is covered by a germ-laden mucous membrane. This slimy layer causes physical attacks to slide off harmlessly. However, it becomes unable to breathe and will die if its body dries out. Because of this, it stays in damp, shady areas. Goomy's horns have powerful sensors that allow it to locate any sign of the enemy, allowing it to survive any kind of danger. As seen in the anime , its diet consists of leaves.\nIn Hisui , when Goomy evolves into Sliggoo , it gains an additional Steel-type along with a metallic spiral shell due to its mucus having a reaction to the iron-rich waters of the region.\nGoomy and its Hisuian evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Shelter . Additionally, prior to Generation IX , Goomy and its evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Gooey as an Ability .",

On top of its head are two pairs of antenna-like horns; the front horns are small nubs, while the hind horns are considerably longer. Its gelatinous body forms a spiral shell-like structure on its back. Contained within the shell are its brain, heart, and other organs.\nSliggoo excretes and coats its body with sticky mucus that can dissolve anything. Because it lacks teeth, it sprays this liquid onto prey and slurps them up once they are dissolved. Since its slime can melt through anything, predators stay far away from it. Its eyes have devolved, causing it to go blind. This makes it difficult for it to tell allies from prey and it will sometimes attempt to melt its companions. Its four horns act as a radar system and are used to detect sounds and smells. Sliggoo only cares about food and will flee from its enemies whenever possible.\nPrior to Generation IX , Sliggoo and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Gooey as an Ability .",

            "description": "Goodra is a bipedal, draconic Pok\u00e9mon that is coated with slime. Most of its body is pale purple with a darker purple underside. It has bright green eyes, two green spots on each cheek, a relatively long neck, and a short, rounded snout. On top of its head are two pairs of antenna-like horns. The foremost horns are small nubs, but the hind horns are longer, thicker, and curve down its neck. The tips of the larger horns are slightly curled. It has proportionally short limbs with two digits each and a large, thick tail with a curled tip. Along each side of its tail are three green spots. A pale green slime is usually visible dripping from its chin and arms. It is known for having a great affinity for water, being able to live within water with no difficulty at all, as well as dive and surf all around the area.\nBecause of its meek, friendly nature, Goodra is often teased for supposed weakness. Goodra is known to be very friendly. When it grows close to someone, it will hug them and leave them coated in slime. If it is left alone, it will ooze gooey tears. Goodra usually misunderstands instructions, appearing dazed or bewildered. Despite this, many Trainers don't mind it, instead finding this behavior to be adorable. However, it will strike at its tormentors with its retractable horns and powerful tail. Goodra can become uncontrollable once enraged. The horns can hit 100 times harder than the blow of a heavyweight boxer. It is also capable of throwing punches with incredible force. Its slimy coating in combination with a layer of fat causes attacks to slide off. Goodra lives in plains and mountains, usually during rainy days.\nPrior to Generation IX , Goodra and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Gooey as an Ability .",

            "description": "Klefki is a small, grayish-white Pok\u00e9mon that resembles a key ring with four keys. It has a spherical head with a small, pink oval on its forehead. Two black circles and a keyhole form its eyes and mouth, respectively. Below its head is its pink, teardrop-shaped body with a white, teardrop-shaped marking in the middle. Extending from the top of its head is a horn that resembles an old-fashioned key with two wide, blunt teeth. Extending from either side of the key is a thin loop that surrounds Klefki. Hanging from the loop are various keys that this Pok\u00e9mon has collected. As seen in the TCG , the loop is highly mobile and can split both at the top and the bottom, allowing Klefki to collect new keys and even express its feelings. Klefki is very tiny, tying with Alolan Diglett and Meltan as the shortest Steel-type .\nKlefki are known to be very even-tempered. In the past, Klefki inhabited mines. When the minerals on which it fed became scarce, it moved on to human settlements. It now feeds on metal ions by inserting its key-like horn into chinks in metal. It likes to collect keys, particularly master keys, and will sneak into people's homes to steal them. It collects keys to feed on their metal ions, as well as to threaten predators by rattling its collection at them. It is said that Klefki's key-like appearance is the result of an adaptation to suit its habit of collecting keys. Although it feeds on keys, it will never release a key it likes, holding onto to it for decades, so people will give it important keys as a way to prevent theft. However, on rare occasions, it will discard a key without second thought. In the past, nobles kept Klefki for generations, taking great care of them while entrusting them with important vault keys.\nKlefki is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Fairy Lock . In Generation VI , Crafty Shield was also one of its signature moves .",

It has glowing yellow eyes, a pair of fangs in its upper jaw, and pointed ears that curve slightly. On top of its head is a long tuft of fur that curls tightly at the tip. A collar of furry-looking tufts hangs over the edge of the pumpkin. Pumpkaboo becomes active after dark. The holes in its body can glow and illuminate the way for travelers in the dark. It is said that it also carries wandering spirits to the afterlife by storing the spirits in its body. However, its own spirit is trapped in this world. Pumpkaboo can hypnotize and control any humans or Pok\u00e9mon. It does this task by releasing streams of light from the holes in the pumpkin.

Poking out of the top of the pumpkin is its slender brown-orange head, which has bright yellow eyes and a small mouth but no visible nose. Gourgeist has long, light pink hair with arm-like tendrils framing its face and bangs that usually cover one eye. On top of its head is a crescent-shaped tuft that is brown on top; this tuft resembles a pumpkin's stem. In the animated series, Gourgeist has shown the ability to retract its upper body into the pumpkin, giving it the appearance of a traditional jack-o'-lantern. On the night of a new moon, Gourgeist wanders town streets while singing an eerie song. Those who hear its song will be cursed. It is also known to sing joyfully while observing prey it has entangled in its arms.

It has yellow eyes, a black triangular marking on the inner corner of each eye, three tufts of spiked fur on each cheek, two dark purple teardrop-shaped spots on the front of its face forming the shape of a nose-leaf, a black lower jaw, and two spiked tufts of fur on its upper lip. Its large, teardrop-shaped ears resemble loudspeakers ; they are dark purple on the outside with alternating rings of pale and dark purple fading to black on the inside. Fluffy black fur covers its chest and hips. On the middle joint of its wings are small black hands with two fingers, and it has two long toes on each foot.\nNoibat can be found in pitch black caves. They rest in the caves during the day and only leave during the night. From its large ears, it is capable of emitting any kind of wavelength of sound, including ultrasonic waves of up to 200,000 Hertz. It uses these waves to stun large creatures, communicate with other Noibat, and immobilize prey. It also uses ultrasonic waves to perceive its surroundings, allowing it to fly in the dark. It is very fond of fruits, and uses its sonar to detect its ripeness. It tends to mistake Applin for its food.",

Its large, teardrop-shaped ears have alternating rings of blue-green and black on the interiors and resemble loudspeakers . Around its neck is a fluffy mane of white fur that is longer in the back. Its wings have three red claws on the middle joint and are divided into segments by two black wing fingers. On the back of the wing, the final segment is purple. Noivern's feet have two toes each and a red, claw-like growth on top of each toe. It has a long, whip-like tail with a blue-green underside and two spines near the tip.\nNoivern is known for its violent temper, but becomes tame if approached with its favorite ripe fruits. From its ears, it can produce ultrasonic waves strong enough to shatter large boulders. It uses these waves to freely navigate through the darkness. Noivern is also known to be cruel, ruthlessly tormenting enemies that cannot see well in the dark \u2014 such as Hydreigon \u2014 before using its ultrasonic waves and fangs to finish them off. However, Noivern becomes timid when exposed to the light.",

            "description": "Xerneas is a quadrupedal, stag-like Pok\u00e9mon with four pairs of antlers. Its coloration varies slightly depending on whether it is in Active Mode or Neutral Mode. Regardless of mode, its main body is always black with a blue stripe down its back and a short, bushy tail. Starting at its knees there is a blade-like trim around each leg, which forms a point under each hoof. There is an upside-down, V-shaped marking on its chest in the same color as the trim on its legs. Its head and neck are blue, and there are two large, tufts that extend onto its chest and curve upward. Its first pair of antlers extends onto its head and curves around the underside of its eyes. The eyes are black with X-shaped pupils. There is a short marking on top of its snout and an upward curving horn on each side of its head in place of ears.\nIn Active Mode, its markings, antlers, and trim on its legs are pale gold. Its antlers have branches and bumps in many colors and there are multicolored spots on its back. Xerneas assumes this Mode during battle or when using its power. Xerneas is at full power when in Active Mode.\nIn Neutral Mode, its markings and antlers are instead pale blue and the embellishments on its antlers and spots on its back are a darker blue. Xerneas assumes Netural Mode when not battling and traveling. This remains until it needs to use Active Mode.\nXerneas has the power to share eternal life. This occurs when the horns on its head shine in seven colors. Xerneas can use its life energy to create vast forests and restore life to them. It can infuse both humans and Pok\u00e9mon with energy and vitality. Because of this, Xerneas is highly respected by the ancient people of Kalos for its role in giving life. Xerneas is also known to be able to speak through telepathy. According to legend, Xerneas is known to have rescued wounded Pok\u00e9mon during an ancient war. Xerneas and Yveltal have the power to transform Evolution stones into Mega Stones as seen with the ultimate weapon 's blast shot by AZ 3000 years ago. Both are in charge of taking care of the land in a delicate balance between life and death. Xerneas's power can also be used to power up machines such as the ultimate weapon. It can also absorb the energy around itself, sharply strenghtening itself as a result .\nAs seen in Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction , if it expends too much life energy, it transforms into a tree and sleeps for 1,000 years. Xerneas has the power to revive those who have been petrified by Yveltal . However, as seen in The Legend of X, Y, and Z! , it couldn't undo Aila 's case for unknown reasons. It was also shown capable of calming Yveltal should it get enraged. In Sylveon Enchants , Xerneas was shown making plants grow by simply touching them.\nXerneas is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Geomancy . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Fairy Aura as an Ability .\nA special Xerneas is worshipped in Lental for being one of the seven guardian Illumina Pok\u00e9mon , in particular for saving the region from a meteorite 2000 years ago. It is also believed to be the originator of the Illumina phenomenon. It resides in the Aurus Island Illumina Spot .",

The back of its body is black with white spots along the wings and back; its front, head, and neck are bright red with branching, black lines throughout. It has a pointed, beak-like snout, bright blue eyes, a black, forward-curving horn over each eye, and a thin, antenna-like growth behind each eye. A feathery gray ruff encircles its neck and billows out over its back. Yveltal's wings each have three spikes along the bottom edge near the body and five large, black claws on the tip. It has small, birdlike legs with gray talons. Each foot has two toes facing forward and one pointing backward. Its tail is similar in structure to its wings, including the five claws on the tip.\nYveltal has the power to absorb life energy by spreading its wings and tailfeathers. According to legend, Yveltal does this in order to power up its own energy. It is highly feared by the ancient people of Kalos because of this. It is known to appear during the conflict, draining countless people and Pok\u00e9mon that Yveltal encounters. When it reaches the end of its lifespan, it steals the life energy of everything around it and then transforms into a cocoon to sleep. Yveltal along with Xerneas have the power to transform Evolution stones into Mega Stones as seen with the ultimate weapon 's blast shot by AZ 3000 years ago. Both are in charge of taking care of the land in a delicate balance between life and death. Yveltal's power can be used to power up machines as seen with the ultimate weapon. It can also absorb its target's energy, restoring its vitality as a result .\nIn Pok\u00e9mon the Series , any living creatures drained by Yveltal will turn into petrified stone, but it's unknown whether this action is intentionally malicious or not. As depicted in Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction , Yveltal can be very vengeful to anyone who disturbs its sleep and will seek to destroy it. Its counterpart Xerneas has the power to cure Yveltal's victims by filling them with life energy, but as seen in The Legend of X, Y, and Z! , it couldn't undo Aila 's case for unknown reasons. Xerneas is also shown capable of calming Yveltal should it get enraged. In Sylveon Enchants , Yveltal was shown making plants wither away by simply touching them.\nYveltal is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Oblivion Wing . Yveltal is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Focus Blast by leveling up. Additionally, Yveltal is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Dark Aura as an Ability .",

            "description": "Zygarde is a green and black Pok\u00e9mon whose form depends on the percentage of Zygarde Cores and Zygarde Cells it has gathered together. Zygarde's Cores and Cells do not have the power to battle alone and can only fight when combined to form Zygarde. Zygarde serves as the protector of the planet's ecosystem. Zygarde is shown to be capable of gathering the energy of the land and focus it on its foes, damaging them. It has the ability to divide its cells from its body temporarily, using them as weapons, either as arrows or waves. Zygarde usually stays out of the sight of others. It has been referred to as a 'guardian of the ecosystem' due to its role to defend the world's order and in Rhyhorn Charges, it has been reffered to as 'Z'. Zygarde keeps a close watch on the planet and on its two counterparts Xerneas and Yveltal, ensuring the equilibrium of the planet and the cycle of life and death are kept in check. Additionally it is capable of reversing the effects of its counterpart's abilities Fairy Aura and Dark Aura. Normally, Zygarde avoids getting involved in conflicts unless the ecosystem is in grave danger. Examples of it are battles between Xerneas and Yveltal and invasions from Ultra Beasts. As seen in Pok\u00e9mon the Series, should Zygarde be affected by outside influence, its color changes from green to red. Zygarde is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Land's Wrath, Thousand Arrows, Thousand Waves, and Core Enforcer. It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Aura Break and Power Construct as its Abilities. Zygarde has three forms: 10% Forme, 50% Forme, and Complete Forme, which are composed of Zygarde Cores and Zygarde Cells.",

Its upper body has two arms and is covered by a white material that resembles a dress. Its small, mitten-like hands poke out of the sleeves. Around its neck is a golden, half-circlet with a pink diamond in the center. Its head is gray with purple eyes that have red sclerae and pointed ears. On top of its head is a collection of pink crystals forming a headdress. There are four spike-like crystals along the top, a long crystal on either side hanging downward, and a large circular centerpiece on its forehead. There is a small, golden piece hanging off the center crystal and a small pink diamond embedded in the back of its head.\nDiancie is born from a Carbink that undergoes a mysterious mutation. It can instantly create diamonds by compressing the carbon in the air. Diancie uses these diamonds to both attack and defend itself . Diancie's pink, glimmering body is said to be one of the most loveliest sights to experience in the world. Diancie is also said to be one of the most beautiful Pok\u00e9mon seen in the world. Diancie is found living in underground caves filled with diamonds such as the Diamond Domain , a crystal kingdom where it reigns as queen over many Carbink, as it has occasionally been seen traveling or living with others. Diancie can speak through telepathy, as depicted in the movie Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction .",

On either side of its head is a dark gray horn that curves slightly upward. Its body has a dark pink, V-shaped marking on the chest and a small, golden spike on each shoulder. Its arms are not attached to its body and instead float next to it; each arm has a small golden spike similar to those on its shoulders. It has mitten-like hands and dark pink rings around each wrist. In place of actual legs, it has a wispy tail. Hoopa has three gold rings: one large one around its lower body and one hanging freely on each of its horns.\nIn the past, Hoopa's true power is said to have been sealed in the Prison Bottle for the destruction it used to cause, reducing Hoopa to a much smaller and weaker form; opening the bottle grants Hoopa its true form once again, but only for three days. The rings on Hoopa's body can warp space and allow it to transport items, humans , and Pok\u00e9mon by passing them through its hoops. This power allows it to cause mischief and take anything it wants. It stores all of its gathered loot in a secret spot only it knows. Hoopa is said to have the power to bend dimensions. It is heavily implied to be the one causing many of the Mirage spots in the Hoenn region . As seen in Pok\u00e9mon Masters EX , Hoopa can even bring people and Pok\u00e9mon from alternate timelines . Hoopa is also known to like donuts.\nHoopa Confined is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Hyperspace Hole .",

It has pointed ears with blue interiors, bright blue eyes, yellow markings over and behind its eyes that resemble eyebrows and eyelashes, a pointed, yellow mandible, and a spike-like protrusion on each cheek. Its body is divided into three segments: a considerably larger front portion that has a hunched back, a thin, blue waist, and smaller hips that resemble its front portion. On its chest are four yellow, diamond-shaped bumps. There is a thin, yellow band around each of its leg joints and the lower, maroon portions of its legs are larger than the thin, blue upper portions. Each ankle has a short, blunt growth, while each foot has three yellow claws. Volcanion has a short, tapering tail with a slightly shorter blue bump along the top. On the back of the front portion of its body are two arm-like cannons. These cannons are normally held together and form a ring around the back. Each cannon is separated into three segments by bright blue lines and each segment has a single blue dot and a short, blunt growth. The topmost segments also have four small, yellow bumps around the ends.\nVolcanion has an organ that allows it to vaporize the water it absorbs instantly with extremely high temperatures. The arms on Volcanion's back expel the resulting steam from inside its body, allowing it to disappear into the dense fog. It can expel steam of superbly high pressure and has the ability to blow away mountains. Volcanion is capable of creating explosive shockwaves . This power also allows Volcanion to gouge out the earth and changing the land by reshaping it. It's said to live in mountains where humans do not tread. Volcanion can run out of water within its body to use, as depicted in the movie Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel . When it does, a sound similar to a bell is heard, the lines and dots on its cannons turn red, and it is unable to use any Water-type moves until it refills its water supply from another source. It was also shown that Volcanion can live for several centuries.\nVolcanion is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Steam Eruption .",

            "description": "Rowlet is a small, avian Pok\u00e9mon resembling a young owl with a round body and short legs. Its plumage is primarily beige with a white underside and facial disc . The facial disc itself is in the shape of two overlapping circles. It has large black eyes and a stubby beak. The top part of its beak is white, while the lower half is orange-brown. Its feet have two forward-facing toes and one backward-facing toe; they are the same color as the lower half of its beak. Two leaves sprout from its chest arranged to resemble a bowtie. Additional leaves form its tail and line the undersides of its wings.\nA nocturnal Pok\u00e9mon, it will store energy during the day through photosynthesis. It approaches opponents by silently gliding, before unleashing a volley of kicks. This Pok\u00e9mon can rotate its head almost 180 degrees and has excellent night vision. Its feathers are as sharp as blades, which it launches at foes from the air. Rowlet feels most relaxed in tight, dark spaces. Rowlet is known to even nestle into its Trainer's bag or the front of their jacket. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy .\nRowlet and its evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have the Ability Long Reach .",

            "description": "Dartrix is an avian Pok\u00e9mon that resembles an owl. Most of its plumage, including its heart-shaped facial disc , is white, but it has dark brown feathers covering its head, shoulders, and back. Its large eyes contain dark irises and usually appear closed. It also has a stubby beak with a white upper jaw and an orange-brown lower jaw, and a few short tufts of feathers on the back of its head. Two green leaves curve around its face, resembling an asymmetric cut ; the leaf on its right is longer than the one on the left. Under its chin are two smaller leaves that resemble a bowtie, and there are two pointed ones on its rear that form its tail. Its wings have two tan spots on the upper side and leafy plumage close to the body on the underside. Within the leaves under its wings are two sharp orange-brown feathers known as blade quills. Dartrix has orange-brown talons with two toes facing forward and one facing backward.\nThis alert Pok\u00e9mon is sensitive to the presence of others around it, and is capable of launching attacks on unseen enemies behind it. It propels its blade quills at enemies or prey with astounding precision. By bending the feathers, it can even alter the trajectory of its strikes. However, it can occasionally miss hitting at times. Dartrix is narcissistic by nature, spending a lot of time grooming its feathers to maintain its appearance. This compulsion will occasionally lead to it losing focus when its plumage is ruffled or dirty, even retiring from battle to preen. It has been described as a bit of a birdbrain as it has a tendency to make mistakes; when it does, it sometimes tries to cover it up, which ends up making the situation worse. A Trainer who helps Dartrix through this difficult stage of its life will allow it to reach its full strength. Conversely, Dartrix will refuse to listen to a Trainer who doesn't diligently help it groom.\nIn Hisui , Dartrix tends to expose itself to sunlight in order to gain power, presumably due to the region's cold climate. As a result of the harsh environment, Dartrix becomes more sturdy when it evolves into Hisuian Decidueye , gaining the Fighting type instead of the Ghost type.\nDartrix and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have the Ability Long Reach .",

Its eyes are reddish-orange and it has a hooked dark green beak. The feathers covering its wings and back are brown, while the rest of its body is primarily white. The three feathers at the tip of each wing are structured similar to fingers and have lighter tips. The backs of its wings and torso are dotted with many white spots, there are six on each wing. The inside of each wing has a line of upside-down, reddish-orange triangles across the top. It has long legs, feet with two toes facing forward and two backward, and short dark green talons. Its tail consists of three long, green leaves.\nA leafy hood covers its head and shoulders, and partially covers its face. The hood is smoothly draped across the shoulders and back, but has uneven edges. Around the head, the hood forms many pointed projections that extend over its face. A single white feather with a reddish-orange base extends from the top of its hood. In the center of its chest is a reddish-orange X shape formed by dead leaves. Extending from its hood are two vines that, when pulled, close the hood further over Decidueye's face and improves its focus. The vines can also be used as bowstrings.\nWhile this Pok\u00e9mon is cool and cautious by nature, it begins to panic if surprised. It can hide from opponents by masking its presence, allowing it to attack unaware foes. It takes only a tenth of a second for it to pluck, aim, and fire an arrow quill from its wings. It is not only quick but also accurate, capable of striking targets over half a mile away.\nAlolan Decidueye is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Spirit Shackle . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move Sinister Arrow Raid . Additionally, Alolan Decidueye and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have the Ability Long Reach .",

            "description": "Litten is a quadrupedal, feline Pok\u00e9mon covered with primarily black fur. It has a short muzzle with a tiny, black nose, red eyes with yellow sclerae, and short, pointed ears with pale gray insides. There are two red stripes around each of its legs and two horizontal stripes with a vertical stripe across them on its forehead. The lower part of Litten's face is also red, and there is a large tuft of fur on each cheek. A tuft of fur sits at the end of its long tail. When it arches its back, three-pointed tufts of fur with red tips appear along its spine.\nLitten is a solitary Pok\u00e9mon that does not typically display its emotions, and it is usually advised that it not be given too much affection. It will scratch those who try to pet it without earning its trust, which takes some time to develop. While grooming, Litten collects fur inside its stomach. By setting the stored fur alight, it can spit fireballs that change based on how it coughs. Litten's fur produces flammable oils, and when it begins shedding, it burns all its fur in a blaze. Its fur coat regrows twice a year. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy .",

            "description": "Torracat is a quadrupedal, feline Pok\u00e9mon . Its upper half, which includes its tail, is covered mostly in dark gray fur, while the fur on its lower half is mostly reddish orange. On its back, a stripe of reddish orange fur runs down its spine, with other two smaller horizontal stripes going across it. A similar fur pattern is seen on Torracat's face, though now it moreso resembles an upside-down double cross: the vertical stripe extends up from its head, forming a short cowlick , and the lowest horizontal stripes tilt upwards into a V-shape above its eyes, forming its eyebrows. Its eyes have yellow irises and black pupils with a red tint at the bottom and are heavily outlined in black fur. Its ears are pointed up and have light gray fur at the base. It has a short muzzle, a tiny triangular white nose, and tufts of fur sprouting from each of its cheeks, which make up its mane. Its tail is thicker the farther away from the body and ends in several tufts of fur, giving the impression it has blown up. Its forelegs are more developed than its hind legs, capable of bending iron with a single blow. Each paw has three tows, with the front ones being larger and ending on short black claws. On its tail and legs, there are two rings of opposite-colored fur.\nHanging from Torracat's neck is a round, bell-like organ, which is yellow with an orange core. This fiery organ is actually Torracat's flame sac, which produces the flames it uses to attack; when it does so, the organ sometimes flares with wing-like projections to the sides. The fire bell responds to Torracat's emotions, blazing hotter according to its spirits, and rings brightly whenever it spews fire or in the heat of battle. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Exhibition Unmasked! , its fire bell is also capable of absorbing flames from outside sources and converting them into its own power. In addition, Torracat's mane acts as a sensory organ, allowing it to navigate in darkness and sense hidden foes. It is also an indicator of its wellbeing, standing on end when it is in a good mood and lying flat when it is not feeling well.\nTorracat loves to battle, and its relentless onslaught causes others to lose the will to fight. Outside of battle, it sometimes behaves like a spoiled child in front of its Trainer and other Pok\u00e9mon, showcasing a more affectionate side to itself in comparison to its pre-evolved form . It, however, still is fickle and fitted with sharp claws, leaving those it has grown to trust marked with scratches.",

            "description": "Incineroar is a humanoid feline Pok\u00e9mon with a muscular build. It has a short snout with a small red nose, bright green eyes with yellow sclerae, and tiny, pointed ears. Large tufts of red fur extend from its cheeks, and much of its face is also red. The upper half of its muzzle and the top and back of its head are black. A thin red stripe runs vertically along its head to its snout, where it splits into a V-shape over its eyes. Its torso is gray with several black stripes and seems to resemble a wrestler's tank top; the front and back both have a single vertical stripe up the center, crossed by two horizontal lines. Around Incineroar's waist is a belt formed from flames that somewhat resembles a championship wrestling belt. In the front center is a small, yellow flame shape. The arms, legs, and tail are all red with black stripes forming bands around them. The arms have three stripes, spiky tufts of black fur over the shoulders, and large five-fingered hands with white claws and a single light red pad on the palm. Its legs have only two stripes and simple three-toed paws, and the tail has one stripe and a tuft of spiky black fur around the tip.\nIncineroar's flame belt is produced from within its body and bursts from its navel and waist as its fighting spirit rises. In addition to spewing fire from its navel, it uses ferocious kicks and punches. Incineroar is an expert on no-holds-barred battles. The flames from its navel can reach a temperature of up to 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit. This Pok\u00e9mon disregards the safety of its opponents and on-lookers, sometimes striking the opposing Trainer with attacks. Incineroar usually attacks first by unleashing both ferocious punches and flinging furious kick combos and then finishing the opponent by spewing fire from its navel. It is a violent Pok\u00e9mon with rough, aggressive, and egotistical behavior. It will sometimes ignore its Trainer's orders when it is not in the mood to listen. Despite this, it finds fighting unworthy opponents boring and gets motivated to fight a challenging one. Weak or injured opponents also cause them to lose the desire to fight, which others sometimes use to their advantage.\nIt also values the attention of the crowd as Incineroar's spirit goes up while the crowd is excited or falters when the crowd is bored. When Incineroar's fighting spirit rises, so does the temperature around its navel waist. While it tends to act like a heel , Incineroar is very happy internally when receiving the admiration of children or young Pok\u00e9mon. It is also willing to help out children and small Pok\u00e9mon, further showing its hidden soft side.\nIn Generation VII , Darkest Lariat was its signature move.\nIncineroar is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move Malicious Moonsault .",

There is a small, rounded earflap on each side of its head. Around its neck is a light blue ruff, which extends past its shoulders. It has four flippers. The front flippers are larger than the hind and have white markings separating its toes.\nPopplio can snort bubbles of water from its nose, which it uses as part of its battle strategy. On land, it uses the elasticity of its bubbles to perform acrobatic stunts and jumps. Popplio practices daily with increasingly larger water bubbles. The sheer force of their bubbles bursting can deal a lot of damage. It can swim at 25\u00a0mph (40\u00a0km/h) Popplio has complete control of its water bubbles. Popplio is famous for its hard-working nature. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy .\nPopplio and its evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Liquid Voice as an Ability .",

            "description": "Brionne is a light blue, pinniped Pok\u00e9mon with three ruffle-like growths around its body. The first ruffle is just under its front flippers, while the last is shortly before the tail. The ruffles alternate between white and pale blue. Its long ears are made up of three segments that lighten and increase in size towards the tip; the first segment is ovoid, while the latter two are spherical. It has a long, conical snout with a white tip, a spherical pink nose, and large dark eyes with pinkish pupils. Its front flippers are much longer than its tail flippers, although both have white tips. There are three digits on the front flippers.\nBrionne is a skillful dancer. While it normally learns to dance from members of its colony, Brionne can also learn to dance from humans. It works diligently to memorize each dance through imitation and gets excited when it sees a dance it does not know. It is capable of dancing in perfect time with others, even if it's never danced with them before. Large groups of Brionne can be seen dancing together on moonlit nights when the sea is calm, sometimes being led by the singing of a Primarina . Brionne has a caring nature; if its Trainer is feeling down, it will perform a dance to cheer them up.\nAs Brionne dances, it creates water balloons in a variety of colors. Its battle strategy consists of dancing while creating water balloons. The dance confuses the opponent, and during this weakness, Brionne slaps the balloons toward the target where they explode. Only those who have earned its trust can see this Pok\u00e9mon when it is sad. It will otherwise always act cheerful and never allow its sorrow to show. [1]\nBrionne and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Liquid Voice as an Ability .",

It has a long snout with a round, pink nose, bright blue eyes with long white eyelashes, and long light blue hair trailing off the back of its head. A tiara -like structure rests on its forehead, consisting of a line of pearls with a pink sea star at one corner and a thin, transparent blue fin extending back over its hair. Its hair is contained to a ponytail by two strings of pearls. This ponytail, as shown in the games and anime , becomes temporarily undone when it performs certain moves. On its body are three fins similar to the one on its crown: one that drapes around its shoulders and chest, one around its waist where the fishtail begins, and one near the tip of its tail. It has long front fins with three digits. Primarina's long fishlike tail is bright blue with small pointed, pink fins around its hips. Its tail fins are white, and it is capable of using them as feet to stand up.\nPrimarina uses water balloons and its voice as its main weapons. Because its voice is instrumental in its battle strategy, its care should be a priority for Trainers. The melody it uses has been passed down for generations. Water balloons are released as it dances, and are controlled by its voice. In the moonlight, the balloons glitter and create a beautiful scene. However, some of the balloons are explosive and triggered by touch. This theatrical Pok\u00e9mon considers every battle a stage and uses the non-explosive balloons as platforms to tease opponents. [1]\nPrimarina is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Sparkling Aria by leveling up. Primarina is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move Oceanic Operetta . Additionally, Primarina and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Liquid Voice as an Ability .",

There is a white, mask-like marking on its face. This marking extends down its neck before ending in a tuft of feathers on its chest. A large crest sweeps upward from the back of its head with a red stripe along the top that ends at its beak. The undersides of Pikipek's wings are white, and it has thin gray legs and feet. It has a flat tail.\nDespite its slender appearance, Pikipek has powerful neck muscles and is able to strike 16 times per second with its beak. Pikipek does not feel pain when using its neck muscles. This allows it to not only drill through wood, but shatter stone as well. The holes it drills in trees are used for nesting, storing food, and collecting small, glittering objects. The noise of this Pok\u00e9mon pecking can be used to communicate with others. This Pok\u00e9mon feeds on Berries and is able to attack opponents by zipping the leftover seeds at them. These shots have enough force to embed the seeds in trees. Talonflame is a natural predator of Pikipek, while Pikipek itself preys on Metapod . It generally lives in humid forests.",

The majority of its beak is orange, changing to light red and then black at the tip. The beak is flexible and can be bent to produce over one hundred different calls. It has round blue eyes and pale gray eyebrows. Pointed feathers extend from the back of its head and form a short crest. A white marking covers its face and extends down over its chest; the undersides of its wings are also white. Around its neck is a jagged, red band, and it has a long tail with three tail feathers. It has spindly blue legs with two toes facing forward and two facing backward.\nTrumbeak feeds on Berries and stores the seeds in its beak so it can fire them off in a burst when encountering both enemies and prey. New plants grow from the seeds that Trumbeak scatters. The cries that it makes with its beak prove to be very noisy to its neighbors. Trumbeak lives in areas dense with trees.",

            "description": "Toucannon is an avian Pok\u00e9mon with black feathers and a prominent beak similar to a toucan , with the upper part being larger than the lower part, or the mandible. There are gases inside its beak, which can ignite and launch seeds with enough force to shatter boulders. Additionally, its temperature can exceed 212 \u00b0F (100 \u00b0C) and cause severe burns on contact. Toucannon can use this beak to warm up eggs, as shown in the anime .\nExcept for the black tip on the upper part, Toucannon's beak can change colors as it heats up, although it normally has four bands of red, orange, and yellow at the top, and solid red on the mandible. As Toucannon heats up its beak, the bands on the upper beak glow and turn red (or sometimes bright yellow in the anime ) one-by-one, from tip to base. When its beak cools down, both of its parts are momentarily solid yellow, before resuming their normal colorations.\nAround the base of the beak is a thin black band with two extensions into the upper jaw similar to nostrils. There is a white marking covering Toucannon's chin and chest, and a half-circle, yellow marking on each cheek. Toucannon has dark blue eyes, light blue eyelids, and jagged, gray eyebrows. It has a long tail with a spiky ruff of red feathers around the base, and spindly blue legs. Each foot has two forward-facing toes with black talons and two rear-facing toes with no visible claws. Its tail seems to be bent specifically for the purpose of holding it momentarily, as it can stand on it for short periods, possibly as a brace when firing seeds.\nIn order to communicate, Toucannon strike each other with their beaks. The number and strength of the hits reflect how it is feeling. Toucannon is well known for forming loving couples, which makes it a common good luck charm at weddings.\nToucannon is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Beak Blast .",

It has short, rounded ears on the sides of its head, a short snout with a pink nose, and a large mouth full of pointed teeth. There are three black claws on each of its four short legs. Despite its length, Yungoos is thick-bodied and has a wide, flat tail with longer fur on the tip.\nYungoos has a voracious appetite and is always hungry, which in turn makes it more ferocious. Much of its body is dominated by its stomach, and it is able to digest food quickly. Its strong teeth allow it to crush and consume the hardest of objects. This Pok\u00e9mon stalks through its territory searching for food until it passes out from exhaustion. However, it is believed that Yungoos decides its territory based on safety so that it can collapse anywhere without fear. It is able to eat anything, but usually prefers fresh hunt. This Pok\u00e9mon is found in Alola , although it is not native to the region and was imported there. Prior to Generation VIII , Yungoos and its evolved form, Gumshoos , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Stakeout as an Ability .",

            "description": "Gumshoos is a long-bodied Pok\u00e9mon similar to a mongoose. While it moves on all fours, it is capable of standing on its hind legs with its hands locked behind its back, similar to a human. Most of its coat is brown with a yellow underside that extends over the top of its tail. It has an additional yellow stripe that starts on its forehead and ends between its shoulders. There are tufts of fur near its shoulders, hips, and around the base of its tail. These tufts in combination with its yellow underside create the impression of an open trenchcoat . Its ears are rounded with a small notch and are located on the sides of its head. It has a short snout with a pink nose, a large mouth full of pointed teeth, eyes nearly hidden under its yellow stripe, and tufts of yellow fur on its chin. There are three black claws on each of its four short legs. Despite its length, Gumshoos is thick-bodied and has a wide, flat tail with longer fur on the tip.\nGumshoos hunts by patiently waiting along its prey's known travel routes and pouncing when the unsuspecting prey comes along. Due to its tenacious personality and ability to withstand intense hunger, it is able to wait for its prey for long periods without eating. Its favorite prey are Rattata and Raticate , but since Gumshoos is diurnal, it rarely encounters them. It is also known to prey on Skwovet . Once the sun sets, this Pok\u00e9mon's stamina is depleted and it will fall asleep where it stands. It is not originally from Alola , and was brought over to take care of Rattata outbreaks.\nPrior to Generation VIII , Gumshoos and its pre-evolved form, Yungoos , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Stakeout as an Ability .\nA special Gumshoos in Alola acts as the Totem Pok\u00e9mon for Ilima 's trial in Verdant Cavern . This Gumshoos possesses Z-Power , an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem Gumshoos and completing the trial is a Normalium Z .",

Its head is dominated by two large, yellow mandibles with reddish-orange tips. The rest of its head is brown and has a reddish-orange structure with a yellow rim on top. It has large, black eyes with white pupils.\nGrubbin typically lives underground. It uses its jaw as a weapon, a tool for burrowing, and for extracting sap from trees. Additionally, it can create sticky threads, which it shoots from its mouth and uses to swing around as though on suspension wires. It also uses these threads to stop opponents from moving, so it can then grab them in its mandibles, which are strong enough to snap thick tree branches. Even its natural enemies, such as Rookidee and Hoothoot , would rather run away than risk getting caught in its mandibles. It loves electricity and can be found near power plants. They can also be found near Electric-type Pok\u00e9mon, as a means of avoiding attacks from bird-like Pok\u00e9mon. [1]",

The last two sections have a thin, ring-like marking and a stubby brown leg on each side. Each eye is covered by a blue screen and is only visible when it glows. Two short, yellow spikes extend from the front square: one on each side of its rectangular mouth. The mouth itself is gray and has two jaws that close sideways, shaped like a lightning bolt when open.\nCharjabug is often found half-buried in earth or leaves, munching on large quantities of humus . The sturdy shell covering Charjabug's body protects it from attacks, allowing it to eat peacefully. This diet helps Charjabug evolve into Vikavolt . In its body is an electric sac, which it uses to store electricity generated by digesting food. The electricity it stores could run a household for a whole day and can be shared with other Pok\u00e9mon. People on camping trips are grateful to have a Charjabug around. It can discharge electricity from the tips of its jaws to attack especially persistent opponents. Charjabug will zap anyone who accidentally steps on it. As shown in the anime , it can send sound waves to communicate with nearby Grubbin. Vikavolt is known to clasp Charjabug in between its legs and use it as a battery to enhance its Electric-type moves , unless it is in an aerial battle.\nCharjabug is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Battery as an Ability .",

            "description": "Vikavolt is a beetle-like Pok\u00e9mon with a large pair of mandibles. Its small orange face has robotic, yellow eyes and is covered by a blue carapace. The mandibles extend from this helmet. They are blue on the inner surface and yellow on the outer surface. At the base of each mandible is a large spike and the inside is lined with short spikes. Its body is black and divided into three sections by yellow rings. The last two sections have a yellow spot on each side. On its back is a pair of wide, flat wings that are transparent with blue elytra . It has four legs; the front pair of legs has two claws, while the back pair has only one.\nVikavolt produces electricity with an organ in its abdomen and controls it with its huge jaws to fire powerful electromagnetic beams. Vikavolt shoots these to strike down bird Pok\u00e9mon. When it clasps a Charjabug in its legs, it is able to utilize it as an extra battery. This allows it to rapidly fire its powerful beam attacks. However, during fierce aerial fights, it will release Charjabug to make itself lighter and more mobile. It is an adept flier, capable of acrobatic maneuvers such as tailspins and sharp turns. Even as it weaves through complicated tangles of branches in the forest, it is able to maintain high-speed flight. It is known to have a rivalry with Pinsir and Heracross . As shown in the episode A High-Speed Awakening! , it likes to drink tree sap . In that same episode, it is shown that, in Alola , there is a competition known as the Vikavolt race , where Trainers can have their Vikavolt race for the chance to win a Buginium Z .\nA special Vikavolt in Alola acts as the Totem Pok\u00e9mon for Sophocles 's trial in Hokulani Observatory . This Vikavolt possesses Z-Power , an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem Vikavolt and completing the trial is an Electrium Z .",

            "description": "Crabrawler is a crustacean Pok\u00e9mon resembling a crab . Most of its shell is purple with blue and yellow accents. It has two long, yellow antennae over its eyes. One blue eyelid is usually half-closed, giving it the appearance of a black eye . The purple shell covering its body appears to be made of three parts: two plain plates covering the shoulders and part of the chest and one plate covered in blue stripes across its underside. A large portion of its yellow body is visible down the center of its chest and a tiny spot is visible in the center of its back. Crabrawler has three pairs of legs. The two rear pairs are smaller with yellow joints and blue tips. The foremost pair of legs has large blue pincers resembling boxing gloves . There is a small amount of meat in its claws, which is considered delicious.\nA competitive Pok\u00e9mon that hates to lose, this Pok\u00e9mon uses its large claws to protect its face and belly while it closes in on opponents. Crabrawler's pincers sometimes break off from overuse but grow back quickly. Crabrawler's pincers are a popular ingredient for paella, making a tasty soup stock. Crabrawler strives to achieve not only a high social standing but a physically higher position as well. It can be found clinging to buildings or even tall people and will punch anyone who attempts to remove it from its perch. In the event that it does lose, its mouth will foam before it faints.\nWhile it is capable of splitting tree trunks, it usually punches trees to knock down ripe berries. Many Crabrawler will gather around a tree to compete for the ripe berries. Crabrawler also preys on Exeggcute . It has been known to mistake Exeggutor for coconut trees, which shake and stomp Crabrawler off when climbed.",

            "description": "Crabominable is a crustacean Pok\u00e9mon that resembles a crab covered in white fur. The fur is fluffier around its mouth, shoulders, and claws; the fur is absent on its face, the tips of its legs and arms, portions of its chest and abdomen, and oval spots on its back and arms. The parts of Crabominable's body not covered in fur are dark blue in color, except for the light blue on its face, claws, and legs, as well as light blue stripes on its abdomen. On top of its head is a patch of yellow fur with two tufts extending upward. Its face has white eyes with slanted black pupils, and a large mouth where two blunt teeth are visible. Below its mouth is a dumbbell -shaped protrusion; together with its abdomen, they create the impression of pectoral and abdominal muscles. Its arms are segmented into three parts. The arm segments grow in size with the smallest being closest to the body. Its claws have a dark blue pawprint-shaped marking on the tips which create Bigfoot prints on snow. The mark that would be the \"palm\" of the paw is actually the lower half of the claw. Its four legs are short, with pointed tips that are freezing to the touch, as shown in Pok\u00e9mon Refresh .\nCrabominable grew its fluffy fur to combat the icy cold of its mountain home. It can also store cold in its claws, which are capable of smashing ice walls or halting avalanches. In desperate times, the claws can even be fired like rockets. Additionally, Crabominable can freeze its opponents in place by firing icy bubbles from its mouth, which is useful since Crabominable has a slow movement speed. Crabominable's detached pincers are said to have a delicious taste; some Trainers have been known to use Lechonk just to find these pincers.\nPrior to Generation IX , Crabominable was the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Ice Hammer .",

            "description": "Cutiefly is a tiny Pok\u00e9mon with a pair of comparatively large wings. It has a pale yellow body with a white face and tail. It has large eyes with spots resembling pixels in them, a long brown proboscis, and two tiny transparent tufts on its head resembling antennae. It has wide, flat white wings with a brown loop marking toward the bottom. In between its wings is a white tuft of fuzz. It has four spindly legs with round feet.\nCutiefly is capable of detecting the aura of living things, such as plants, people, and Pok\u00e9mon. It uses this ability to predict the movements of its opponents. Cutiefly's diet consists of pollen and nectar, drinking it through its long proboscis. Any pollen it does not finish is stored in its fur. It collects nectar and pollen from flowers, which are found by the color and brightness of their auras. However, when a living creature is excited, its aura resembles a flower in full bloom. As a result, Cutiefly tends to gather around beings feeling strong emotions. When Cutiefly draws close, it will painfully poke them with its long proboscis. This Pok\u00e9mon can be found in fields and meadows but is sometimes attracted to towns or buildings by the emotions of living beings. Loving nectar and pollen, it often gets into skirmishes with Butterfree over food. It is known to be drawn in by Fomantis 's sweet scent and Gossifleur 's pollen. Spinarak and Pineco are natural predators of Cutiefly.\nCutiefly is one of the shortest Pok\u00e9mon in existence. Additionally, it is the lightest Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon in existence.",

It is covered in fluffy, yellow hair and has a white face and lower body, and a tuft of hair on its back. It has big eyes with one white and one brown square speck in the center. Over its eyes are white hairs similar to eyelashes, and it has two black antennae. Around its neck is a brown scarf with a needle-like projection on the front. Two wings nearly as large as its body sprout from its back. The wings are white with three brown loop designs near the base. Its four thin limbs have bulbous hands or feet. It is one of the shortest Pok\u00e9mon in existence.\nRibombee uses its fluffy hair to hold pollen it collects from flowers. Rain turns its hair dirty and its pollen damp, so it only visits fields if the weather remains clear. When storms are on the horizon, Ribombee hide in tree hollows and wait stock-still. The pollen and nectar it collects are used to form balls called \"Pollen Puffs\". These balls can be used as food or relieve tiredness with a soothing effect. The Alolan people sell Pollen Puffs as valuable nutritious supplements. When Rimbombee senses a human or Pok\u00e9mon feeling sad, it will cheer them up using handmade pollen puffs.\nIn Generation VII , Ribombee is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Pollen Puff .\nA special Ribombee in Alola acts as the Totem Pok\u00e9mon for Mina 's trial in Seafolk Village . This Ribombee possesses Z-Power , an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem Ribombee and completing the trial is a Fairium Z .",

            "description": "Rockruff is a quadrupedal, canine Pok\u00e9mon . It is primarily light brown with a darker brown muzzle, paws, and ear tips. It has large blue eyes, button ears , a short muzzle with a triangular pink nose, and a short tuft of fur on each cheek. Around its neck is a ruff of grayish-white fur stubbed with dark brown pebbles. The dark brown markings on its paws extend to a thin point on each wrist and ankle. It has a grayish-white tail that curls tightly over its back and is covered in fluffy fur.\nRockruff has an excellent sense of smell and will never forget an odor after smelling it once. There are tales of it reuniting with its Trainer after becoming lost by following the faintest traces of scent. It has lived with humans since ancient times. Rockruff is often recommended as a good Pok\u00e9mon for beginner Trainers due to its friendly nature and ability to bond with Trainers easily. However, Rockruff is said to be a challenging Pok\u00e9mon to raise, to the point where some Trainers abandon it due to being unable to handle it. This Pok\u00e9mon is very sociable and will greet others by rubbing them with the rocks around its neck. As it ages, Rockruff becomes wilder and more independent. Once it is close to evolving, it will begin to howl when the sun goes down. It has been said to leave its Trainer's side and return once it has evolved. Despite becoming more vicious as it matures over time, Rockruff never forgets its master's kindness. Wild Rockruff travels in packs until it evolves. A persistent Pok\u00e9mon, it will keep going until it outlasts foes that are even more powerful. Rockruff intimidates opponents by using the rocks on its neck to hit the ground. As mentioned in Rocking Clawmark Hill! , Rockruff trains itself by running around. It attacks foes the moment they flinch. It has been known to fight with Growlithe over territory.",

It has large, light blue eyes with irises that resemble puddles of water and dark blue eyelids. The head and tail are both white. There is a line of white teardrop-shapes on each side of its body with the teardrop nearest the head being slightly larger. The top half of its body is dark blue and has a short, rounded dorsal fin. The lower half of its body is gray with two pectoral fins. This tiny Pok\u00e9mon is both the shortest and lightest Water-type. An individual Wishiwashi is small, weak, and notably tasty. As a result Wishiwashi has numerous natural predators, including humans, Dewgong, Wailmer, Wailord, Wingull, and Pelipper. While Wishiwashi are known to move in schools, they're more often seen alone. Wishiwashi also gather when confronting opponents. It can call on its friends by shining its eyes seen as an SOS signal almost 25 miles (40 kilometers) away. Wishiwashi is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Schooling as an Ability.",

The body consists of two sections; the top section is slightly smaller and overlaps the lower. On top of its head is a starfish-like collection of ten tentacles. All of the tentacles reach the ground, except for the one directly in front, which is shorter and leaves its face exposed. The tentacles are light blue and covered in purple spines. On top of its head is a purple area with a collection of spikes with a larger, yellow spine in the center.\nMareanie is able to regenerate any body part overnight, except its head. The lost limbs have a very bitter, astringent flavor, and thus they cannot be eaten as food. Bruxish feeds on Mareanie, which in turn eats the branches of Corsola \u2014 except in Galar , where it has not yet learned to prey on them. Mareanie also eats broken-off Pincurchin spines, despite the risk of getting electrocuted. It uses the spike on top of its head to poison its prey and uses its tentacles to either trap its prey or deal the final blow. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Sun & Moon episode, The Sun, the Scare, the Secret Lair! , it is seen attaching itself with all of its tentacles and releasing poison through its spines. The poison causes numbness and intense itching. Mareanie live in groups and are found in beaches and the bottom of oceans.\nMareanie and its evolution, Toxapex , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Merciless as an Ability .",

The main part of its body, consisting of a small head with protrusions similar to starfish arms below it, is a purplish pink. Its head is dark blue on top, near where its legs connect. This part of its body is typically suspended in the air due to the length of its legs.\nThe legs themselves are light blue on top and dark blue on the undersides. The legs are filled with spines, which can protrude towards the outer leg or retract into the inner leg. The inner spines are purplish pink, and when they are present, the outer spines sink back into its legs, and vice versa. The tip of each legs has two orange claws, and there is a ring of orange spines around a purplish-pink marking where all the legs meet on top.\nToxapex uses its legs to walk along the ocean floor, where it hunts for Corsola . They can also be used to create a dome-like shelter, protecting it from the tides and, in colder regions , trapping its body heat to keep it warm. Toxapex's spines sense the flow of tides, allowing it to survey its surroundings. Its spines can also be fired at enemies and carry a powerful poison, which causes pain for 72 hours (3 days), even to Pok\u00e9mon as large as Wailord . Aftereffects of the venom remain even after recovery. If a foe bypasses its spines, it attacks with its claws instead. Bruxish is its natural enemy. Toxapex competes against it in warm ocean currents, despite the odds being against it.\nToxapex is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Baneful Bunker . It and its pre-evolution, Mareanie , are also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Merciless as an Ability .",

It has a dark brown coat with a cream-colored underbelly, muzzle, and circular markings on each cheek. A short, teardrop-shaped blaze extends up from its muzzle, and it has long, pointed ears with pink insides. Its large eyes have horizontal pupils. Black bangs hang over its face before turning into a stiff mane along its neck. Additionally, it has a short, black tail. Thick, cream-colored mud surrounds each black hoof.\nMudbray can be kept happy by giving it time to frolic in and consume mud. Mudbray's diet consists of eating dirt in order to create mud. It then regurgitated the mud in order to cover itself in it. Mudbray's mud won't dry out, even when exposed to the sun for long periods of time. Denying it this will cause it to become stressed and disobey its Trainer. This Pok\u00e9mon boasts immense strength for its size and is able to drag or carry loads up to 50 times its own weight. Mudbray are known to be skilled at using mud. The mud that collects around its hooves enhances its grip and power. Notably, it allows Mudbray to travel rough terrains without slipping. Because it was hunted nearly to extinction when it lived all over the world, it was believed for a time to run wild only in Alola . Despite this, Mudbray have been seen roaming in Galar and Paldea , suggesting that its population is slowly recovering from near extinction. Prior to Generation IX , Mudbray and its evolved form, Mudsdale , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Stamina as an Ability .",

            "description": "Mudsdale is a large, equine Pok\u00e9mon with short, brown fur and a black-and-red mane and tail. It has heavy-lidded, black eyes with a red rim along the bottom, a red blaze on its muzzle, and long, pointed black ears with brown insides. This Pok\u00e9mon's mane extends down around its eyes. Along the top of its neck, its mane is black with red at the tip, and stands up straight. On either side of its neck, the mane forms three thick structures similar to dreadlocks with red mud around the tips. The mane extends all the way down Mudsdale's back in a thin line before becoming its tail. The tail appears similar to its dreadlocks but is much larger and has several black notches missing from the mud around the tip. Around its hooves is a protective coating of red mud, which has three notches around the bottom.\nMudsdale is known for both its powerful body and emotional fortitude, which prevents it from becoming agitated. Regardless of the trouble it is in, it will never cry out and will defeat opponents with a single blow. The mud around its legs gives its kicks extra force; one kick can turn a car or large truck into a scrap pile. When galloping, its hooves can dig holes in asphalt. While it is not swift, it has excellent stamina and can continue on for three days and three nights while dragging over 10 tons. It will mix dirt and saliva to create a special mud with resistance to both wind and water. The mud is also harder than even stone. Because of its unique qualities, the walls of some old houses were coated with Mudsdale's mud. Mudsdale is highly treasured for both physical labor and pottery made from its high-quality mud. In Alola , Mudsdale is used as a Ride Pok\u00e9mon called Mudsdale Gallop, to allow natives to travel across rocky terrains.\nPrior to Generation IX , Mudsdale and its pre-evolved form, Mudbray , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Stamina as an Ability .",

Its head and most of its abdomen are dark gray, while its thorax and six legs are light green. All of its legs are thin with a knobby joint in the middle, and three of its legs are typically used to anchor the bubble on its head. Sometimes Dewpider will secretly swap which legs will hold up the bubble. The green on its thorax extends onto its abdomen in three triangular markings. Several triangular flaps extend upward and attach to the bubble over its head. The head itself has large light blue eyes with darker pupils and sclerae, two blue bumps on top, and a light green mouth similar to a spinneret. There is an actual spinneret on the tip of its abdomen, which the anime has shown as capable of producing both silk and water bubbles.\nDewpider can only breathe oxygen dissolved in water, so the bubble over their head allows them to breathe on land. Dewpider uses the sticky silk it creates to form a sturdy water bubble that will rarely burst. Additionally, the bubble protects its soft head and can be slammed into both prey and enemies. If two Dewpider meet, they compare bubbles and the one with the smaller bubble will move out of the way. It supports the water bubble that envelops its head with three of its legs.\nDewpider and its evolved form, Araquanid , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Water Bubble as an Ability .",

It has three pointed, blue bumps on top of its head and four fang-like projections underneath. Both the bumps and its eyes are capable of glowing.

At the end of its abdomen is a light green spinneret. It has six light green legs with opaque bubbles around the joints. The tips of its legs are dark gray.\nAraquanid uses the bubble around its head as both a weapon and a protective shield. The bubbles it launches will have a sticky effect. It will headbutt enemies with it, and small Pok\u00e9mon can be sucked in and drowned. Foes it traps inside these bubbles will lose consciousness before getting torn apart by Araquanid's gnashing jaws. Subdued prey can also be stored inside when the Araquanid is not hungry. However, it will also bring weaker Pok\u00e9mon and valuable items into the bubble for protection.

Bunches of light green leaves surround its head, and a particularly large tuft in front slightly overhangs its face. A small, dark green bulb sprouts from the center of its head, which emits a pleasant aroma. Around its neck is a collar of short, dark green leaves. Extending from its collar are four lighter green leaves with white tips: two in the front and two in the back. In the front, these leaves act as scythe-like arms. Its main body is pale pink with a thick, dark pink stripe down the front and back. It has a stubby tail and two short legs.\nIn order to achieve evolution, Fomantis stores up energy gathered by photosynthesis. It is nocturnal, so during the day, it spreads its leaves wide to catch the sunlight. During the night, it spends its time searching for a new spot to sleep for the next day. It will not stay in the same spot for more than a day due to the danger involved. If anything bothers it while it is gathering sunlight, Fomantis will fiercely attack it. The reason is that Fomantis hates its naps being disturbed. When regularly exposed to sunlight, it grows up with vivid coloration. Though it excels at long-range attacks, it will rarely use those that require it to use its stored photosynthetic energy. Fomantis can give off a sweet and refreshing scent. Bug Pok\u00e9mon like Cutiefly are known to gather near it due to its scent. Trainers who own Fomantis tend to give it a flowerpot, allowing it to sunbathe in peace.",

            "description": "Lurantis is a plantlike Pok\u00e9mon that resembles an insect. The top half of its head is light pink, while the bottom half is white. It has light red eyes, and two green antennae with a small green lump between them. There are four extensions to the top half of its head: two on the top with red tips that resemble ears, and one on each side with white tips that resemble stylized hair. It has a light pink body with wavy, skirt-like extensions around the waist and a green abdomen and neck. Its thin, white arms end in large, red scythes with white along the bottom rim and a single green claw on the tip. There are vertical, pink-and-red stripes down its legs, which have small, pointed green feet. The coloring and shape of Lurantis's body and arms give it the appearance of wearing a long-sleeved dress, while its legs are similar to pants. Four red, wing-like appendages sprout from its back, each tipped with white.\nLurantis both looks and smells like a flower, a trait that it exploits to lure foes in for a surprise attack. By gathering light, Lurantis can fire laser beams using its sickle-like arms. Its brilliant coloration and elegant moves have earned it acclaim as the most glamorous Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon. However, it does disguise itself as a Bug Pok\u00e9mon for protection. Maintaining its appearance requires detailed grooming. If a Trainer does a good job caring for it, Lurantis will have an easier time trusting them than a lazy Trainer and have gorgeous, brilliant colors. [1]\nThese beams can cleave metal plates. In Generation VII , Solar Blade was its signature move .\nA special Lurantis in Alola acts as the Totem Pok\u00e9mon for Mallow 's trial in Lush Jungle . This Lurantis possesses Z-Power , an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem Lurantis and completing the trial is a Grassium Z .",

It has large, black eyes with pale green half-circle markings on the outer sides. Small bumps ring the top of its head, similar to hair. Its head is much larger than its thin, stem-like body. At the base, the stem splits into three green roots that act as feet. Three large mushrooms sprout from the center of its head. Each mushroom has a thin white stem and a darker ring of color around the base of the cap. The center and largest mushroom is light pink, while the other two mushrooms are smaller and a light purplish-blue. At night, Morelull can make the spores filling its mushroom caps glow.\nMorelull likes dark, damp areas such as dense jungles, but changes locations every night to avoid depriving the plants in any one area of too many nutrients. In addition to locomotion, its roots are also used to communicate with other Morelull. When in danger, it scatters spores that burst into bright, glittering sparks. The pulsing light of the spores can induce drowsiness. It is rumored that once when a group of Morelull were disturbed and all threw out their spores at once, a plane passing overhead suffered a near brush with disaster. . The caps on Morelull's head are a delicacy for Pok\u00e9mon living in the forests and can grow back overnight.\nIn Generation VII , Strength Sap was its signature move , but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .",

The lower part of its body and stubby feet are covered in a fluffy pink substance. The mushroom cap on its head has a fluffy pink rim, pale green bumps on top, and a pale green, gilled underside.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon lives in dark forests and competes with Parasect over territory; their fights often leave the area coated in spores. In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode Lulled to La-La Land! , Shiinotic has been shown illuminating the spot and gills on its mushroom. This strange light can confuse people who enter its habitat, causing them to lose their way. Additionally, the flickering spore it releases can cause drowsiness. It takes advantage of sleeping prey by sucking their energy through the tips of its arms. It can also transmit energy to whomever it likes, be it human, Pok\u00e9mon, or vegetation, through the same method.\nIn Generation VII , Strength Sap was its signature move , but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .",

            "description": "Salandit is a small, black Pok\u00e9mon resembling a salamander or lizard. Its body is dark gray with a black head and feet. Along its back and down its tail is an orange-red line. This marking splits into four short lines with round tips at the base of its tail. At the base of its neck are two short, flat spines, which create the impression of a mask or bandanna tied around its head. Its eyes are light purple with slit pupils and there are several tooth-like protrusions along its upper jaw. Each foot has four pointed toes.\nSalandit is found around volcanoes or arid, rocky environments. From the marking at the base of its tail, it can emit both toxic gas and flames. The gas is created by burning body fluids and has a sweet odor that causes dizziness. However, Bug Pok\u00e9mon are attracted to the scent and are common prey. The female can also release pheromones that attract males of all species, including humans . Additionally, these pheromones may cause opponents to be controlled by this Pok\u00e9mon's will. Because of this, male Salandit offers its food to females, leaving it malnourished and unable to evolve. While it is not a powerful Pok\u00e9mon, it is able to unbalance opponents with its cunning techniques. It does have difficulty with Spinda , since that Pok\u00e9mon is already off balance. Prior to Generation IX , Salandit and its evolved form, Salazzle , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Corrosion as an Ability .",

            "description": "Salazzle is a dark gray Pok\u00e9mon resembling a salamander or lizard. Its thin body has a grayish purple underside with several wavy, dark pink markings: a U-shaped marking with two additional lines inside on its chest and one on each hip resembling wisps of smoke. The dark gray on its head and neck extends slightly onto its chest in a V-shape. It has a slender head with purple, almond-shaped eyes with slit pupils and two fang-like projections on each side of its lower jaw. There are two thin, wavy growths on its back at the base of its tail, which is whip-like with a dark pink underside. Its hands and feet each have five long, thin digits, with dark pink palms that can unleash flames. Salazzle is a female-only species with no known male counterpart, as the male Salandit cannot evolve due to malnutrition.\nSalazzle can be found deep in caves with a reverse harem of male Salandit . Salazzle emits a poisonous gas that contains sweet-smelling pheromones, which attract the males. The gas can also be diluted to make perfumes. Salazzle forces the male Salandit it has attracted to serve it and bring it food and those that are unable to are punished with flaming slaps. Salazzle fight with each other over male Salandit; the winner is the one with the most male Salandit in its harem.\nAs shown by the core series games since Generation VIII , Salazzle normally stands and walks on all fours, standing on its hind legs only in specific moments such as when battling or interacting with its trainer. Illustrations for the Trading Card Game also show its ability to stick to surfaces with its feet, allowing it to walk on all fours even on vertical and upside-down surfaces.\nIn Generation IX , Fire Lash is its signature move . Additionally, prior to Generation IX, Salazzle and its pre-evolved form, Salandit , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Corrosion as an Ability .\nA special Salazzle in Alola acts as the Totem Pok\u00e9mon for Kiawe 's trial in Wela Volcano Park . This Salazzle possesses Z-Power , an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem Salazzle and completing the trial is a Firium Z .",

This is actually an organ that releases an odor used to communicate with others of its kind.\nDespite its small size, Stufful has extraordinary strength and can knock out even well-trained Pok\u00e9mon if they are unprepared. The combination of its cute appearance, mannerisms, and fluffy fur make it very popular. However, Stufful actually dislikes being touched and will flail its powerful arms if it is embraced. Stufful's flailing is powerful enough to break thick tree trunks. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Stufful is filled with power despite sleeping. It is often seen flailing about and moving constantly while sleeping.\nPrior to Generation VIII , Stufful and its evolved form, Bewear , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Fluffy as an Ability .",

Across the top of its head is a white band with two tufts of fur on each end. This white marking gives it the appearance of wearing a headband with decorative bear ears. It has a short, white muzzle with a triangular black nose and two small, black eyes. There are pink paw pads on its front paws consisting of the palm and three digital pads. The hind paws have three white digital pads on the front. It has a short tail with dark pink rings.\nWhile Bewear may appear friendly, it is actually a very dangerous Pok\u00e9mon \u2014 even considered to be the most dangerous Pok\u00e9mon in Alola . It must never be approached carelessly, even if it is merely swinging its arms around in a friendly fashion, which is used as a warning. It shows affection with a fond embrace, but its hugs have incredible force. Trainers of this Pok\u00e9mon must teach it how to restrain itself when showing affection. Its hugs are powerful enough to shatter bones and have killed many Trainers. The reason Bewear hugs others is due to accepting that person as a friend. Bewear also uses its arms to subdue its prey before taking it back to its nest. Bewear is capable of using amazing martial arts moves. Bewear is said to have learned them by observing Black Belts training in the woods. In Lental , Bewear are known to hibernate during seasons when food is scarce. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Bewear on very rare occasions, is seen hugging a log while sleeping. The reason is due to it mistaking the log for a friend. However, these logs tend to be smashed to pieces accidentally due to Bewear's immense strength.\nPrior to Generation VIII , Bewear and its pre-evolved form, Stufful , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Fluffy as an Ability .",

            "description": "Bounsweet is a small Pok\u00e9mon resembling a mangosteen. Most of its body is pinkish-purple with a short, white bottom around its waist, which resembles the flesh of a mangosteen when it is cut open. It has beady yellow eyes and two tiny legs. On top of its head is a green calyx . This structure consists of four leafy green formations and a short stem.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon exudes a delicious smell from its entire body, which has made it popular with people of the Alola region. This scent has a calming effect on people, so they are often used as living air fresheners. However, its sweet scent has also caused it to be swallowed whole or collected by other Pok\u00e9mon, especially Toucannon and Greedent . It is too sweet for human consumption, but its sweat can be used to make a juice. Bounsweet was highly valued by humans in the past in a time when sweets were rare.\nWhile fleeing danger, Bounsweet skips along in a way that does not convey its desperation. As a result, no one ever comes to help it. It has been known to drive away enemies by rotating its calyx, but it becomes dizzy afterward. [1]",

The calyx has short leaves on the front and back, two large leaves out to the sides similar to pigtails , and a short stem on the top. The right leaf has two yellowish-green spots on it. The upper part of its torso has short ruffles at the top similar to a dress. Its wide hips are made up of six segments and resemble the flesh of a mangosteen . Its slender arms have slightly rounded hands with no visible digits, and its legs have pointed tips.\nWhile it has a delectable fragrance, this Pok\u00e9mon also has a tomboyish personality that can make it hard to get along with. Steenee's scent is a popular antiperspirants used by humans and helps others feel invigorated. Steenee's peeled rind can be used for stomach pains. Its calyx has hardened, allowing it to play with other Pok\u00e9mon without worrying about being damaged. However, the leaves spin as Steenee moves and often strike nearby objects. It apparently does not care what it hits, and even uses the calyx as a form of attack. Foes are struck with the leaves first, then kicked by one of Steenee's equally hard legs. . It also uses those legs to protect itself from its natural predator Corvisquire . Steenee has are known to bounce around the forests it lives in.",

It has heavy-lidded, dark purple eyes with purple eyelids and long purple eyelashes, but has no visible mouth or nose. The lower part of its face is hidden behind a short ruff extending up from its body. While its arms are slender with rounded, digit-less hands, its legs are long and powerful. The upper portions of its legs have three pointed projections just before the hips, creating the impression of long boots. The lower portions of its legs taper into small, pointed feet. It has wide hips made up of six segments that resemble the flesh of a mangosteen . It is a female-only species with no male counterpart.\nOn top of Tsareena's head is a light green calyx . The shortest leaf of the calyx extends slightly forward and then curves to the right, similar to side-swept bangs . The other three leaves resemble long hair and extend nearly to the ground. The three long leaves each have three yellow spots near the top and three near the bottom; the markings are present on both the under and upper sides of the leaves. On top of the calyx is a growth resembling a small, purple crown with four thin yellow stripes.\nTsareena is known to be both powerful and aggressive. This Pok\u00e9mon has a high-class nature and punishes anyone who approaches it with evil in mind. This attitude will even be directed at its Trainer if given commands Tsareena dislikes, such as being told to use an ineffective move. Touching the crown-like growth on its head is said to render it defenseless, however, and instantly calms it down. [1]\nTsareena fights using finely honed kicks and graceful movements. Every time it lands a hit, it cackles at its opponent. It will even continue kicking or stepping on a downed opponent, laughing boisterously. Additionally, its sweet fragrance acts as a distraction. Because only the most powerful Steenee evolve into Tsareena, this Pok\u00e9mon uses its power to protect its pre-evolved forms. Quaquaval is Tsareena's rival in kicking.\nTsareena is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Trop Kick . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Queenly Majesty as an Ability .",

Comfey is one of the shortest Pok\u00e9mon in existence.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon stretches sticky vines from its head to pick flowers to create the ring around itself and will give these rings to those it likes. The flowers can also be thrown at enemy Pok\u00e9mon to create an opening to either flee or attack. However, it feels uneasy without flowers. Comfey spread oil from their body along these flower rings, changing the flowers so that they emit a soothing fragrance that affects both Comfey and its allies. This aroma can also help with the treatment of people and Pok\u00e9mon at hospitals and Pok\u00e9mon Centers . Each Comfey wear different flowers, which give off its own unique scent and never wither. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep , Comfey is known to sleep with a smile and a flower close to its face. The flower is said to have a scent that helps it sleep comfortably.\nComfey is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Floral Healing . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Triage as an Ability . In Generation VIII , this was also true for Flower Veil .",

Underneath each eye is a yellow ring marking, which is encircled by a light blue ring marking. In the center of its forehead is a yellow marking shaped like a four-pointed star. A cape of purple fur covers its back and is divided into many wavy clumps with strands of orange and light blue throughout. The purple fur grows longer as it ages. Oranguru holds a fan created from green leaves woven together with its own purple fur.\nThis solitary Pok\u00e9mon spends its time deep in the forest, meditating high up in the trees. While it is not normally active, it will provide food to hungry Pok\u00e9mon and give medicine to injured ones. It has even been known to use human tools or items, including Pok\u00e9 Balls . It has a lofty attitude and will give other Pok\u00e9mon orders. This can make them difficult Pok\u00e9mon for Trainers to handle. Ancient people actually thought Oranguru were people and called them the \"people of the forests.\" Oranguru does not get along with others of its kind, often battling out their wits for superiority. It will also occasionally venture to the beach to match wits with Slowking .\nOranguru is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Instruct .

Most of its fur is white, but it has a black muzzle, upper body, hands, feet and ankles, and tail. However, there is a wavy white ring near the tip of its tail. The fur around Passimian's head and face is longer and forms many small clumps, especially around the top of its head and under its chin. On top of its head is a pale green helmet similar to half of a coconut shell. The helmet has a small orange blaze on the front and two leaves that stand up straight attached to the back. Its eyes are partially hidden by its headwear, but its yellow sclerae and reddish-orange irises are visible. It is often seen carrying a large berry that resembles a green coconut. There are several leaves stuck on its body with saliva. The shoulders and chest all have one vertical and one horizontal leaf. While most Passimian have green leaves, the anime has shown that there is a red leaf variant on Akala Island that has one additional horizontal leaf in each area. The leaves' color and position are decided by the leader of a troop and aid in distinguishing one troop from another.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon creates troops of 20 to 30 members. Each troop has a leader that picks 10 of the strongest members to search for food. Passimian tend to get into territorial disputes with Ambipom in their search for comfortable trees, in which they win half the time. This Pok\u00e9mon's battle strategy involves throwing berries at opponents, hard ones for damage and soft ones to obscure vision, and confusing opponents by throwing the berry to other troop members. A troop's leader is the member that can throw these berries the farthest. Through rigorous training, the troop improves its coordination, teamwork, and skill in handling berries. Some Passimian are unable to handle the intensity and flee from the troop. In place of a troop leader, a captive Passimian looks to its Trainer for leadership. If its Trainer has poor form when throwing Pok\u00e9 Balls, it will refuse to obey. [1]\nPassimian is the only known Pok\u00e9mon with the Ability Receiver .",

The three plates on its back overlap and each one has a single black triangle in the middle.

There are eight short legs on its underside, and it has a long, prickly tail.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon is cowardly by nature and wary of both noise and sudden movements. However, its curiosity will cause it to approach people or Pok\u00e9mon that are standing still. It will spit a poisonous liquid when threatened. Wimpod sometimes accompanies its evolved form, Golisopod. The stench of this fluid warns others that danger is nearby. Wimpod will eat and store anything, including garbage from the sea.

It has a relatively small head with bright purple antennae that converge with its mandibles to form a mask around its eyes. The eyes themselves are black and angular with light gray pupils. Behind its head and curving down its back are several armor plates, each with a long protrusion curving up from each side. There is a small, greenish triangle marking on the center of each plate. Most of its lower body is exposed, but there is additional armor resembling a loincloth around its waist and smooth pieces encasing its thighs and feet. Its feet each have a single black claw. Golisopod has three pairs of arms. The two foremost pairs are thinner, encased in a silver exoskeleton, and each is tipped with a single, black claw. The hindmost pair of arms is longer and has much larger forearms. These large forearms both have three overlapping, armored plates on the back and two black claws. The plate closest to its claws is plain, while the last two each have two greenish, triangular markings.\nGolisopod has a shell as tough as diamonds and retractable claws that can cleave seawater in two. While it is skillful in battle, it often meditates peacefully deep in seaside caves. It is sometimes accompanied by Wimpod . Golisopod will do anything to win a fight. When it sees an opening to take advantage of, Golisopod will use the small claws on its front legs to finish off its opponent. Grapploct is the natural predator or prey of Golisopod, depending on who wins the fight.\nIn Generation VII , First Impression was its signature move , but Farfetch'd could still inherit it via breeding . Golisopod is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Emergency Exit as an Ability .",

A tunnel through its center acts as a mouth, and a small depression above that has two pebbles for eyes. A red shovel with a white handle is stuck blade first into the top of its head. On either side of its main body is a smaller mound reminiscent of a stubby arm.\nSandygast is known to inhabit beaches, and is born from grudges that seep into the sand, such as from Pok\u00e9mon that suffer defeat in battle or the deceased. It can suck the life force of people or Pok\u00e9mon through its mouth. Apparently, in the Alola region, sticking a hand into Sandygast's mouth is a way of proving one's courage. A person who grabs Sandygast's shovel or puts a hand in its mouth falls under its control. Sandygast uses this power to make children add sand to its body so it can become bigger. Sandygast cares a lot about the shovel on its head. A Sandygast that loses its shovel may replace it with something like a branch or a flag, but it is said to keep searching for its lost shovel. Sandygast attacks prey by flinging sand into their eyes; however, because Sandygast is very slow, its prey tend to escape before it can approach them.\nSandygast and its evolved form, Palossand , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Shore Up . They are also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Water Compaction as an Ability .",

It has a square main castle for its body, two round towers for arms, and the top of another round tower with a conical point rising up from the body. A tunnel through the center of the main body creates a mouth. There is a line of five alternating blue and pink seashells over the top of its mouth, and a similar ring of seashells surrounds the central tower just below the point. The central tower has six windows: three located in the front, one on each side, and one in the back. The two outermost windows in front of the central tower have tiny pebbles in them and appear to act as eyes. The two side towers have crenellations along the top with a ring of windows underneath. Palossand's main body has crenellations around the central tower. In the peak of its tower is a red shovel stuck handle-first into the top.\nPalossand has the power to control the sand, and each grain of its body has a will of its own. It curses and control people and Pok\u00e9mon alike, making them gather sand for it to build upon its body. Unlike Sandygast , Palossand is able to replenish any sand it loses on its own. The shovel on Palossand's head rotates when it searches for prey and is believed to function as a radar. Palossand can be found at beaches, having been referred to as the \"Beach Nightmare\"; however, it hates water. It cannot maintain its castle-like structure during heavy rainfall. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode A Shivering Shovel Search! , Palossand can manipulate its size to grow to the size of a building and whip up sandstorms with a swing of its tower-like arms.\nPalossand captures smaller Pok\u00e9mon into its sandy body by dragging them down into the sand. Once they are trapped, it drains their vitality whenever it pleases, until all there is left under its body are the dried-up bones of its victims, which Palossand is able to fire from the hollows in its arms. The aforementioned Pok\u00e9mon the Series episode shows that trapped victims are unable to escape Palossand's body unless it has suffered enough damage, otherwise they will be pulled back inside; it also suggests Palossand is not able to drain the life force of humans. Wherever it passes, traces of its victims' ill will are left, which are said to be the genesis of new Sandygast.

This Pok\u00e9mon is capable of spitting its organs out through its mouth. The white organs can take different shapes, such as a fist. Two lines of three pink spikes run down each side of its back. The middle spike of each line is about twice as long as the others are. A fluffy white puff forms its tail.\nPyukumuku tends to find a spot it likes and stay there, even returning to the same spot if moved. Once all the food in its favorite spot has been consumed, it will continue to stay there to the point of starvation. Its body is coated with a viscous fluid that allows it to stay on land for a week without drying out. This fluid is also beneficial to people as a moisturizer. If stepped on, it will expel its fist-like organs and smack the perpetrator. It particularly hates having its mouth or spikes touched. Tourists dislike Pyukumuku due to its appearance and lifestyle and often accidentally step on Pyukumuku. This creates a need for part-time jobs on beaches chucking this Pok\u00e9mon back into the sea. However, people in Alola have already taken to throwing the Pok\u00e9mon back to the sea where it can find food when thin. Pyukumuku is shown to have a symbiotic relationship with Pelipper , which carries it after scooping it from the water.\nPyukumuku is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Purify .

Its head is enclosed in a brown helmet with green markings, designed to suppress its power to stable levels. The helmet is extremely heavy and hinders it's agility. The helmet has a large jaw piece that wraps around the front with large, round hinges on the side. Each hinge is covered by a green X-shaped marking. The name of the Pok\u00e9mon, as it wears the helmet, is called Null meaning nothing.Small gray eyes can be seen from within rectangular black holes on the front, and there are two pointed ears on the top. Around the base is a collar with four protruding vanes that are tipped with a three-way spike. This collar has a thin green line between the vanes, and each vane has a green hexagon near the end. An axe-like blade with a band around the middle extends backward from the top of the helmet. The front tip of the blade has a small, silver spike that hooks downward. A mane of gray fur hangs from below Type: Null's helmet and covers its shoulders and chest. Most of its torso and legs is covered in short black fur. The lower half of each front leg is insectoid and green with spikes along the back, while the rear legs have thick purple scales on the flanks, shins, and on the top of the foot. All four of its feet have three toes, but in the front two toes face forward and one backward. Additionally, the hind paws have a short, gray claw on the back of the ankle. Its fishlike tail consists of two dark blue spines with a light blue fin stretched between them. The top spine has a line of short, gray spikes.",

            "description": "Silvally is a quadrupedal, chimeric Pok\u00e9mon with traits from a variety of creatures, with an appearance nearly identical to its pre-evolution, Type: Null . It has a mammalian head with mechanical parts. Covering most of its head and neck is a thick, silver mane that extends down over its chest. Its blunt snout is metallic on the bridge of its nose and upper jaw. Silvally has a triangular black nose framed by three red lines, pointed ears with bright pink and black insides, one visible fang on each side of its lower jaw, and a slight overbite. Its eyes are bright silver, have no visible pupils, and appear to be surrounded by an empty, black space. On each side of its head is a circular, metallic drive , with a white circle crossed by a metal line. On top of its head is a large, axe-like fur or feather crest. The tip of the crest has a hooked, metallic piece, while the back has three white feathers. Silvally's lower body is mostly covered in short, black fur. The lower half of each front leg is insectoid and green with spikes along the back, while the rear legs have thick purple scales on the flanks, shins, and the top of the foot. All four of its feet have three toes, but in the front two toes face forward and one backward. Additionally, the hind paws have a short, gray claw on the back of the ankle. Its fishlike tail consists of two dark blue spines with a white fin stretched between them. The top spine has a line of short, gray spikes.\nOnce Type: Null finds a trusted partner and forms a powerful bond with them, it destroys its control mask and finally evolves into its original form, Silvally. After its evolution, it reactivates its RKS System , gaining the ability to change its type through the Memories created by the Aether Foundation ; this ability was based on the powers of a certain Pok\u00e9mon depicted in myths . It was created as part of the beast killer project as an \"Anti- UB Fighting life-form\", however, the project was deemed a failure and a control helmet was built to seal away its power, turning it into Type: Null. It reverts back to its natural, wild temperament, but it is still extremely loyal to its Trainer , and it will even risk its own life in its partner's defense . Gladion was the one who coined Silvally\u2019s name, but when it was created, it was named as \" Type: Full \" due to its ability to change between all Types.\nSilvally is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Multi-Attack . Additionally, Silvally is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have RKS System as an Ability .",

In its Meteor Form, Minior resembles a modestly sized rock. Its rocky exterior is formed by four large plates separated by two large cracks. The cracks encircle its body both horizontally and vertically. Five white spikes extend just above the rocky surface, giving it a star shape. Two large, black spots on its front resemble eyes, and there is a third spot in the center of its back. Rings of dark brown triangles surround the holes its spikes protrude from and the spot on its back, pointing outward. One of the triangles surrounding the spot on its back is replaced with a small, brown dot. The eyespots have a half-ring of triangles resembling eyelashes. One eye has a small, brown dot in the corner. Even while apparently at rest, Minior tends to spin slowly in place.",

Its large, ovoid black nose extends up between its fluffy white eyebrows, and there are additional white puffs of fur on each cheek. There is a small ruff of longer, gray fur around its neck. Each hand is black with five short fingers, and it has three black claws and a black paw pad on each foot. Its underbelly is white, as is its short fluffy tail. Komala is usually seen holding a short wooden log, which it is given at birth. The log is typically a light brown with darker, oval markings all over it. The ends of the log are tan with the growth rings visible.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon stays asleep from birth to death, staying this way because of its diet of certain leaves containing poison only Komala can break down, which induces sedative properties. While its expression sometimes changes as if it is aware of its surroundings, this appears to be a result of its dreams instead. It is able to eat, travel, and even battle without waking. If the log pillow it clings to is removed, it will be unable to sleep well and thrash wildly. However, it will sometimes cling to the arm of a Trainer it trusts. During a deep sleep, it stops moving altogether. According to ancient people, if a small amount of the saliva created when it eats leaves is watered down and ingested, one will be able to sleep well. This diluted saliva was also historically used as an anesthetic for surgeries. Hypno has been known to hunt this Pok\u00e9mon in Alola , appearing to prefer them over humans.\nKomala is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Comatose as an Ability .",

            "description": "Turtonator is a bipedal, turtle-like Pok\u00e9mon with a spiny shell. Its skin is a muted green and only visible on its limbs, tail, head, and neck. On top of its head is an additional shell with many points around the brim. This extra shell has a black center, yellow in the middle, and a red outer rim. Its eyes have black markings around the bottom, and it has a tubular, yellow snout with a single, large nostril. Turtonator has a wide mouth with the lower lip marked by a jagged yellow line extending from its nose. On each side of Turtonator's long neck are two short, triangular projections. Its front legs have mitten-like hands, while its hind feet have claw-like red growths around them. Most of its tail is also covered by red plating, which has fin-like projections. The shell that encases its body has a red underside with a star-shaped, yellow-rimmed hole in the center. The back of the shell has a yellow center with several spikes: four large spikes with red bases form a star shape in the center with four smaller spikes around them.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon resides on volcanoes, where it camouflages itself among the rocks and waits for prey. In addition to hunting, Turtonator also feeds on sulfur and other volcanic materials. This diet rich in explosive material has contributed to a layer of explosive material in its shell. This diet also makes Turtonator's feces dangerously explosive. The feces can be put to many different uses; in Pok\u00e9mon Adventures , they can be used as makeshift landmines, exploding from a mere touch. When prey steps onto its shell, it strikes itself with its own tail to cause an explosion. The explosion is ignited by sparks from the spikes on its shell and released through the hole on its chest. This orifice also acts as Turtonator's weak point. Its explosive capabilities are dampened by the rain, however, so it takes refuge in caves on rainy days. It is also capable of spewing poisonous gas and flames from its nostrils.\nTurtonator is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Shell Trap .",

It has black eyes, a short pointed snout with a black nose, rounded ears, and a circular, yellow marking on each cheek. Scattered across its back are 14 fur spikes that appear as yellow and brown triangular markings. When attacking, surprised, or agitated, these spikes will stand straight up. There is a tail-like needle on the back of its head. The needle is gray with a yellow tip and is shaped like a lightning bolt. Additionally, it has stubby arms and legs. When Togedemaru's spines are out, its cheek marks sometimes look like electrical outlets.\nTogedemaru uses the needle on top of its head to attract and gather electricity. Groups can be seen gathered with their needles standing upright, waiting to be struck by lightning on stormy days to make up for its somewhat limited electric capacity. Some Trainers use its ability to absorb electricity as a strategy in battle. The opponent is coaxed into unleashing an Electric-type attack, and then has that power turned against it. When it is pleased, this Pok\u00e9mon will curl into a ball and roll around uncontrollably. Togedemaru clashes with Elekid whenever it tries to steal the latter's electricity, usually ending with even matches.\nIn Generation VII , Zing Zap was its signature move .\nA special Togedemaru in Alola acts as the Totem Pok\u00e9mon for Sophocles 's trial in Hokulani Observatory . This Togedemaru possesses Z-Power , an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem Togedemaru and completing the trial is an Electrium Z .",

            "description": "Mimikyu is a small Pok\u00e9mon whose body is almost entirely hidden under an old rag. Its small size makes it one of the shortest Ghost types. Its eyes are beady black through the holes in the body of its disguise however, as seen in the animated series, its eyes are actually purple. Fringe of an amorphous foot or lower body is visible under the hem as well. Occasionally, it will also extend a long, black claw-like appendage from under its rag. When angered, its eyes will glow yellow. The veil itself resembles a Pikachu. The cloth is yellow with black-tipped ears. The Pikachu face appears to be drawn with crayons, consisting of black eyes, red cheeks, and a squiggly black mouth. The rag's head is hollow and can be used to store objects. Mimikyu also carries a small stick resembling a lightning bolt to create a tail for its costume. When its disguise is damaged, the costume's head droops limply backward, revealing Mimikyu's ruse. Larger rips in the costume are accompanied by shadowy vapors pouring out from whatever is hidden within. A lonely Pok\u00e9mon, Mimikyu is always covered by its disguise. It is unknown what Mimikyu's true appearance looks like. However, glimpses of it are seen, such as its claw, its underside, and its eyes. Since this Pok\u00e9mon is weakened by sunlight, it is rumored that the veil is used for protection. It is believed that seeing its true form will cause a mysterious illness or even a painful death. Because of this, Mimikyu will become agitated and violently stop anyone from attempting to look underneath its rag. Mimikyu's disguise is modeled after Pikachu because of the popularity of Pikachu-styled merchandise, thinking that its disguise would allow it to make friends with people.Unfortunately, this attempt makes its disguise look more creepy. Until recent times, Mimikyu was initially thought by humans to be just a ghost wearing a cloth. Mimikyu is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move Let's Snuggle Forever. It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Disguise as an Ability.",

The front of its body is light blue with large, dark purple lips and a mouth full of sharp teeth. The upper half of its body is mostly light purple, while the lower half is mostly yellow. The purple portion of its body is dotted with light blue spots. The yellow underside extends up around its eyes, which are light purple with light blue pupils. Its eyelids are dark purple with long, light blue eyelashes. Its fins are all dark purple, light blue, or a combination of the two colors: the pectoral fins are mostly dark purple with a short line blue line along the bottom, the dorsal fin is light blue, the ventral fin is dark purple, and the tail fin is dark purple with a light blue, heart-shaped marking in the middle. On top of its head is a protuberance with a dark purple bulb at the tip. The bulb is able to open like a flower, which reveals a light blue orb in the center.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon buries itself on the seafloor, leaving only the growth on its head exposed. By emitting a low level of psychic power, it serves as a radar to detect prey. Additionally, the protuberance can emit a strong psychic power. Opponents bathed in this power are stricken with terrible headaches and fall unconscious. Prey, which includes Shellder and Mareanie , are ground into mush and eaten. Toxapex is a rival of Bruxish in warm ocean currents.\nWhen emitting psychic power, Bruxish grinds its teeth, which stimulates its brain and creates psychic energy. This sound is enough to send nearby Pok\u00e9mon fleeing immediately. In the Alola region, lifeguards allow this Pok\u00e9mon to remain in their area to prevent other, dangerous Water Pok\u00e9mon from gathering. Any sunlight reflecting on Bruxish's ripples will cause the water to shine brightly.\nBruxish is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Dazzling as an Ability . In Generation VII , Psychic Fangs was its signature move , but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding .",

            "description": "Drampa is a serpentine Pok\u00e9mon similar to a Chinese dragon . Most of its skin is bluish-green, but the lower half of its face and the underside of its neck is a pale green. There are three spots on each of its sides that are also light green. It has pink eyes with rounded, yellow eyebrows, short whiskers resembling a mustache, floppy ears, and a small, white beard with a circular extension. On top of its head is a mop of white hair split into four rounded sections: two draped down either side of its head. Fluffy white fur drapes the lower half of its body and conceals its arms when they are tucked against its chest. When its arms are spread, two short claws are revealed on each hand. It has a bushy white tail with a small, curved spike at the base.\nThis draconic Pok\u00e9mon lives alone in the mountains 10,000 feet above sea level. The Berries it feeds on do not grow at this altitude, so it descends to the base of the mountains daily at dawn. It loves communicating with people and Pok\u00e9mon, and is especially gentle with children. It will often appear in areas where children gather and play with them. Despite its gentle nature, it becomes enraged if a child it cares for is hurt, and can go as far as to burn the bully's house down if able. As seen in the anime , Drampa is capable of flying.\nPrior to Generation VIII , Drampa was the only known Pok\u00e9mon that could have Berserk as an Ability .",

            "description": "Dhelmise is a Pok\u00e9mon made up of an anchor and a ship's wheel, held together by a mass of green seaweed. The anchor is a rusty brown mottled with blackish spots. The seaweed, which is Dhelmise's true body, partially envelops the thick, curved bottom of the anchor in a zigzag fashion, leaving empty spaces that look like sharp teeth. The seaweed continues upward to cover the anchor's thin shank and the spindle of the wheel. Five individual strands of seaweed trail off this small hub in a star shape.\nThe ship's wheel is lavender on the outside with a yellow inner rim. It is affixed to the back of the spindle by its center and able to rotate freely. The noticeably damaged wheel features six spokes and four handles, all of which are yellow. There are two lavender stubs where the other handles should be. A simple compass, resembling an eye, is set into a yellow ring-shaped component on one side of the wheel; mirroring this is an identical ring on the opposite side, though nothing is set into it.\nDhelmise prefers large prey, such as Wailmer and Wailord . The heavy anchor can be swung with enough force to knock out its prey in a single blow. The victim is then enveloped in seaweed, which can be stretched hundreds of yards, and has its life force drained. In addition to hunting, this Pok\u00e9mon maintains itself by adding new detritus and seaweed to its body. It is known to get along well with Skrelp and Dragalge .\nDhelmise is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Anchor Shot . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Steelworker as an Ability .",

It has a beak-like snout with a small, tooth-like spike in each corner of its lower jaw and big, red eyes. On the front of its head is a large, heart-shaped yellow scale. A small tuft similar to ears or small feathers extends from the back of its head on either side, and there is another small, white tuft on its chest. Six teardrop-shaped, loose-hanging scales form a half ring around its shoulders. These scales are gray with pale yellow along the outside edge. A solid yellow scale of the same shape is on the tip of its tail. Each of its feet has three yellow claws.\nWhile Jangmo-o trains diligently and remains humble, it has the pride of a warrior. It employs the scale on its forehead for both attack and defense, so it never shows its back to its foe. Many Trainers take this behavior as proof of this Pok\u00e9mon's valiant nature. Jangmo-o lives and trains with others of its kind in harsh areas that are far away from other Pok\u00e9mon and people. The scales on its body make a metallic sound when struck and are used to express emotion, communicate with others of its kind, and intimidate opponents. The sounds made by a group of Jangmo-o are known to be particularly noisy.",

It has angular, red eyes, a rounded, beak-like snout with a small spike on either side of the upper jaw similar to teeth, and two small scales standing up on either side of its head. Down the center of its chest is a line of three slightly raised scales, and there is a matching line of four scales down its back. Several slightly raised gray scales overlap its shoulders. In between its shoulders and on each side of its head is a small, white crest made of feathers. It has three yellow claws on each appendage and a long, tapering tail.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon has many scale plates on its body as well. There is a yellow one on its forehead, which is oval with a light yellow, heart-shaped stripe across the middle. Two circular scales cover the front of its neck; both are light yellow with darker edges. The tops of its arms are covered by three overlapping scales. The first two arm scales are gray with yellow trim, but the last scale is red with yellow trim and much larger. At the tip of its tail is a small, circular scale. This last scale has a light yellow portion before ending in a darker yellow.\nThis Pok\u00e9mon leaves its fellows to begin training on its own and can be found wherever there are opponents for it to fight. When it finds an opponent, it dances and clangs its scales together to show its strength. This ferocious dance climaxes with a challenging war cry. Because its scales serve as armor, it overwhelms its opponent with attacks without worrying about its own defense. This battle style causes many of its scales are torn off or broken. Hakamo-o considers its broken armor and bare arms as proof of a well-fought battle and wears them with pride. However, the scale begins growing back immediately and harder and sharper than before. Its scale conduct heat well, so shed ones are often molded into pots and pans.",

            "description": "Kommo-o is a bipedal, reptilian Pok\u00e9mon covered in scaly armor. Most of its body is gray with some lighter gray areas as well as yellow and red markings. It has a rounded, beak-ish snout and small eyes nearly hidden under its head armor. On the tip of its snout is a patch of pale gray and both the upper and lower jaws have a small, tooth-like spike on each side. The top of its head is covered by an elaborate arrangement of scales. At the front of the headdress is an oval scale, which is yellow with a red heart-shape at the base. On either side of the front scale is a chain of four circular scales; the first three scales are red with yellow trim and the last scale is solid yellow. Three additional chains of plain yellow scales extend from the back of the headdress. Running down the front of its long neck is a line of overlapping scales: one solid gray at the top, three larger gray ones with yellow rims, and one solid yellow scale at the bottom. A thick yellow stripe with a rounded projection in the center runs across its chest. Covering its shoulders are tufts of spiky, white feathers with small, gray scales overlapping them. Four overlapping scales cover the tops of its arms: three are gray with yellow edges and the scales that cover its hands are red with yellow edges.\nKommo-o has four scaly chains, all of which consist of four scales, extending from just behind its shoulders. The two foremost chains are made of overlapping scales and have a solid gray scale at the top followed by three scales with yellow edges. The other two chains consist of only solid gray scales and do not appear to overlap. The lower halves of its legs are dark gray and there is a pale gray marking across each knee. Its hands have four yellow claws, while the feet have only three. A long line of slightly raised, pale gray scales runs down the center of its back to about halfway up its tapering tail. Near the tip of its tail are three sets of loose scales that increase in size near the tip. Each set is made up of four separate scales that encircle the tail; the two lower sets are solid yellow, while the set nearest the tip have gray centers. The very tip of its tail is pale gray.\nKommo-o, having completed its harsh training, returns to its birthplace to protect Jangmo-o . However, it only watches over them from a distance. The power of this Pok\u00e9mon's uppercut is enough to send foes flying, so simply raising its arms can generate enough force to change its surroundings. According to legend, Kommo-o's glittering scales are meant to drive away a great darkness. The reason it seeks strong opponents is also said to be a quest for power to defeat the darkness. Its scales function as both offensive weapons and defensive shields. Because it does not wish to fight weak foes, it clangs its scales together when it senses someone approaching. Weak or cowardly opponents will panic at this sound and flee immediately.\nWhile the anime showed that Kommo-o is capable of bipedal locomotion, the core series games since Generation VIII show that it vastly prefers to walk and run around by knuckle-walking .\nKommo-o is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Clanging Scales and Clangorous Soul . Kommo-o is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move Clangorous Soulblaze .\nA special Kommo-o in Alola acts as the Totem Pok\u00e9mon for an unmanned trial in Vast Poni Canyon . This Kommo-o possesses Z-Power , an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem Kommo-o and completing the trial is a Dragonium Z .",

Tapu Koko's head and torso are black with white markings on its chest, just above its eyes, and on top of its head. Extending from the top of its head is a large, orange plume with bristles along the back. There is a yellow marking covering the top bristle and half of the bristle below it. The bottom of this crest goes all the way to its neck, where it divides its face in half and creates a beak-like nose. It has small, blue eyes with yellow markings behind them. The lower half of its body is orange with four pointed projections: one short spine on the front and two short spines in the back, with one longer spine between them. These spines resemble a bird's tail feathers. Its thin arms have round, yellow structures encircling its shoulders. On each arm is a shell that appears to be half of a bird mask, and its hands end in two large claws to create a beak for the mask. The mask itself is mostly yellow with black, orange, and white markings. There are three white triangular markings with black edges on the top of each half of the mask, which create diamond shapes when the mask is closed. The 'eyes' consist of a white diamond connected to a slightly larger orange diamond, which is inside a larger yellow diamond. Each of these shapes is edged in black. On each half of its beak is an orange triangle with a white rim. There are wing-shaped structures on each side, toward the back. Tapu Koko is able to pull the mask together and hide its upper body inside, creating the impression of a stylized rooster.",

On each side of its face is a thick white line that curves upward at the outer tip. There are red rings around its shoulders and golden, cloven hooves at the end of its arms. Its tail is mostly covered in a golden bell with two thin black rings around the top and a wavy black line around the bottom. A tuft of fur is just visible inside the bell. On top of its head is a pair of curved, black horns. Each horn has a thick yellow marking near the tip and half of a wooden shell attached to it.

The shell itself resembles a flower or plant when open; when closed, the horns shift to the sides and it takes on the appearance of a bull.

Above the rectangles are two triangular markings; the top triangle slightly overlaps a larger, yellow triangle. Behind and just touching the yellow triangle is a tiny, white rectangle that creates the 'bull's' eyes. The side has a single, tiny yellow triangle marking.",

It has light blue eyes, white eyelids, and a light blue, fin-like marking around the outer corner of each eye. It has a white T-shaped marking on its forehead and a small, white V-shape on its chest. Around its shoulders are segmented purple rings and its long thin arms have webbed hands with three fingers. Each finger is tipped with a purple claw. On the front of its lower body is a light blue, fin-like projection with three spikes. It also has light blue fins on top of its head that resemble long, flowing hair. Tapu Fini's main body resides inside a violet shell that resembles a swordfish head when closed. The top half of the shell has a fin with light blue webbing on top and a thin, pointed spine on the front. On each side of the top shell are two C-shaped markings facing each other to form a rough circle. One marking is white and one is light blue, but both are outlined in black. These markings form the 'eye' of the swordfish. Along the edges of both shell halves are a series of white triangles with black outlines.",

            "description": "Cosmog is a small Pok\u00e9mon with a gaseous body similar to a nebula . The gases that make up its body range in color from violet to light blue. The very center of its body is black both in front and back. The black space on the front contains its face, which consists of beady yellow eyes, circular blue cheeks, and a small mouth. The space on the back has only a single blue dot. There is a golden half-circlet on both the top and bottom half of its body, which divides it exactly in half. Two wispy extensions containing starry specks serve as its arms. Cosmog's gaseous body makes it one of the lightest Pok\u00e9mon in existence.\nCosmog's body is frail and easily blown away. However, it is carefree and doesn't seem to mind. It collects dust from the atmosphere, which allows it to grow slowly. Cosmog has the ability to warp itself and those close to it. Professor Mohn 's research tells that Cosmog can also open Ultra Wormholes when under extreme stress. This process is very dangerous for Cosmog, and the use of its powers can leave it immobile for extended periods of time, or even fatal when used improperly. According to Lusamine , the gases from Cosmog can also be extracted to create Ultra Wormholes. Cosmog is theorized by the Aether Foundation to be a type of Ultra Beast , and its name was coined by one of the professors at the Foundation. In the ancient times, it was known as \u201c The child of the stars \u201d by the people of Alola . When angered, Cosmog's wisps will puff up in a comedic way. In behavior, Cosmog has an overly trusting nature and it immediately takes a liking to whoever shows it kindness, even when that person doesn't have the best intentions for it. Cosmog is known to be very curious but not very cautious; this behavior has often led to Cosmog willingly put itself in danger, only to teleport away should things get dicey. This Pok\u00e9mon can also be created by Solgaleo and Lunala , probably as a some type of reproduction. The guardian deities watch and protect Cosmog until it fully evolves and returns to Ultra Space to repeat the cycle.",

The main portion of the shell is a flat oval around the center of the orb. Eight more flat, half-oval projections surround the orb in an asterisk-shape. At the center of the main body is a much smaller black core. The upper half of the core has a thin blue line on the front, back, and each side, while the lower has pink lines. On the front are two orange semicircles, which appear to be closed eyes. The overall shape of this Pok\u00e9mon also resembles an eye. When evolving, the Pok\u00e9mon glows either an orange or a purple color, correlating to Solgaleo and Lunala respectively, gaining traits of either a stylized sun or a stylized moon.\nEncased in its sturdy, cocoon-like shell, Cosmoem is unable to move. In Pok\u00e9mon Refresh , it cannot even eat. It grows as it absorbs starlight and the dust in the air. Its body is warm to the touch. Cosmoem's shell is said to be harder than any known material. In the ancient times, it was known as \" The cocoon of the stars \" by the people of Alola .\nCosmoem is one of the shortest Pok\u00e9mon in existence. Despite this, it is also the heaviest Pok\u00e9mon in existence, being tied with Celesteela . Cosmoem's height in the Pok\u00e9dex is actually measured by its width, rather than its height, as seen in its concept art.",

It has a short snout, dark pink eyes with white centers, and a deep blue area on its upper head that shows a constantly changing starscape. A rigid raised hood wraps around its head in a crescent shape and drapes around its neck as well. The outside of the hood is yellow, while the inner part that curves around Lunala's head is white with deep blue streaks. Its torso resembles a ribcage with a slightly curved spike on each shoulder and three spikes extending from the bottom toward its tail. Its massive wings resemble a bat's wings with the skeleton exposed, except that Lunala's wings have a total of seven \"finger bones\": four running through each wing, one running along the edge to the outermost tip, and two pointing upwards that may act as claws that are more functional. The four \"bones\" in Lunala's wings are only visible in segments. The skin of Lunala's wings is an iridescent deep blue and a light blue light source appears to glow from behind its ribcage. A large, pale yellow crescent connects the outermost tip of each wing to the next two inner tips, and the remaining two innermost tips are adorned by yellow, four-pointed stars. The bottom of Lunala's tail is also lined by a yellow crescent with a ridge running up the middle of the tail towards the rib cage.\nWhen Lunala enters its Full Moon phase , its third eye \u2014a light red symbol of an eye\u2014appears on its forehead and the starscape turns to streaks of light. The skin of its wings glows a bright, light blue. It spreads its wings wide so that the golden parts on each wing are arranged in a circle. It enters this phase while using one of its signature moves or traveling through Ultra Space . The phase does not appear in the series as of Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet . [1]\nLunala has long been honored as an emissary of the moon. In ancient times, it was known as \" the beast that calls the moon \". This Pok\u00e9mon constantly absorbs light to convert it into energy and can obscure daylight with darkness. When it spreads its wings to absorb light and glitter, it resembles a beautiful night sky. Lunala's dark energies also serve to shield it from harm . It is said to live in another world , which it returns to when it opens its third eye. Lunala can create Ultra Wormholes to travel to and from Ultra Space. Lunala and its counterpart, Solgaleo , can create Cosmog , which it is said to be the female evolution of.

            "description": "Nihilego is an Ultra Beast that resembles a jellyfish. The bell is semi-translucent and encircled with several white, star-shaped markings. The wavy rim of the bell flares outward and is bright blue. Its tentacles appear gelatinous and give it a vaguely humanoid shape. Several tentacles mesh together forming the appearance of a cape or long hair, while four shorter tentacles resemble shorter hair and arms. Two long tentacles make up the legs of the human shape. According to its concept art, Nihilego's body is made of various types of glass.\nNihilego was the first Ultra Beast to be discovered by Professor Mohn of the Aether Foundation . He was also the one who coined Nihilego's name. Nihilego live in another world named Ultra Deep Sea . Although its exact levels of intelligence are unknown, it is believed to act upon a self-preservation instinct . However, in addition to its human-like shape, it is sometimes seen acting like a young girl. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, Nihilego's most distinctive feature is its parasitic capability. When Nihilego latches on to a host's head, it does not manipulate its actions directly. Instead it awakens the host's own capabilities and boosts them to an extreme extent in order to protect itself. It injects the host with a sort of neurotoxin to achieve this effect. This neurotoxin of Nihilego's is incredibly stimulating and inspires feelings of extreme excitement and a lack of inhibition in its host. Anything or anyone that Nihilego latches on to will have its native skills forcibly activated to their fullest extent and will then act as it naturally desires to.\nWicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Nihilego stores Z-Power , the same energy possessed by Totem Pok\u00e9mon , within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura . As seen in the games and in The Homecoming Crown! , Nihilego are capable of creating illusions, such as making itself and its allies vanish and are even capable of seeing the memories of humans. That same episode also showed that Nihilego can demonstrate emotions other than self-preservation and the ability to heal people.\nIn the games, anime, and manga Nihilego was shown capable of physically merging with its host: Lusamine . In this \"merged\" state, the Nihilego's bell loses its stars, developing several iridescent spots across its surface. Its eight tentacles become long and flattened and have numerous deep black spots with various colored diamond-shapes inside. Four of the tentacles are connected to the bell via frilly white structures; these tentacles have four spines protruding from them that can be used similarly to hands. The remaining four tentacles each terminate in a single larger spine. Lusamine's body also changes and is visible within Nihilego's bell as her legs dangle beneath it. Her hair turns black with golden lines, her eyes turn yellow, half of her legs and dress become black as the other half becomes purple.\nThe toxins produced by Nihilego may remain in the host's body, even after Nihilego has left their body. This can leave the former host to remain ill for unspecified amounts of time and treatment may be necessary. Nihilego leaving a host's body can also cause unconsciousness, as is the case with Lusamine, however it unknown whether or not this is because of Nihilego's toxins, the stress of fusion or the overwhelming amount of Z-Power within her body. As depicted in 10,000,000 Reasons to Fight! , its lower tentacles inject its toxins into the ground while sharp rocks grow below. While the same episode shows that Nihilego can willingly end this merger and it may be disrupted in other ways as well, the lingering toxins and the shock of the separation can leave the host in critical condition, both physically and psychologically. The same episode also shows Nihilego forming a barrier with its own mass to prevent its host from undoing the fusion.",

It has two red compound eyes with two black, spherical basal joints for its red and black antennae between them. Protruding from under these joints is a long, silver proboscis. It has many bulging muscles that appear to be sacs full of a red fluid with small white bubbles inside. There are three sacs on each arm, two on each leg, two on its chest, and several on its shoulders and down its back. Around its waist are three rings of smaller sacs. The muscles on its chest and some on its arms and waist have thin, grayish lines resembling tendons running across them. It has large, five-fingered hands with red knuckles and four pointed legs. There are several black spikes on its body: a small one on each side of its head, two on each shoulder, one on each elbow, and one on each leg. The portions of its body between its muscles are dark red or black. On its back are two pairs of pale orange wings with slightly darker veins.\nBuzzwole live in another world named Ultra Jungle . Its proboscis is said to be harder than a diamond . Buzzole is powerful enough destroy to a dump truck with a single punch. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation , Buzzwole's most distinctive feature is its skill to strengthen itself. Buzzwole is able to absorb energy and then achieve a chemical reaction between the energy it has absorbed and its own body fluids.\nAs a result, Buzzwole's body swells to an almost explosive extent. Its muscles bulge and are so thick and dense that they are stronger even than steel. Both its Attack and Defense experience a clear leap in power. It also displays a habit of striking a pose each time that it takes any sort of action, it is thought this might serve as a method of communication, but it is not well understood.\nWicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Buzzwole stores Z-Power , the same energy possessed by Totem Pok\u00e9mon , within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura .",

Its torso is composed of five thin discs that droop slightly downward. The widest disc makes up its shoulders, the second widest its hips, and the two smallest its chest and waist. There is a gold ovoid inside of the widest disc, where its long, thin neck protrudes from. Its arms and legs are also long and thin with gold joints. Its hands and feet are both composed of two golden claws. Pheromosa has a small, semi-flattened head with a yellow, crown-like structure on top. The two tallest points of the crown point to its long, thin antennae, which are white with small gold balls at the tips. Attached to the back of its head are two structures resembling insect wings. The wings are transparent, curve slightly inward, and reach nearly to the ground. It has narrow, purple eyes with bright blue pupils.\nPheromosa live in another world named Ultra Desert . Pheromosa's speed is believed to be fast enough to dodge lightning . It displays a considerable reluctance towards touching anything as if it interprets the Pok\u00e9mon world as being unclean somehow. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation , Pheromosa can reach speeds exceeding 120 mph [200 km/h] in just an instant. This speed is greater than any other living creature that has been discovered to date. But its most distinctive features may in fact be its beauty and its powerful pheromones.\nMost any creature that squares off against Pheromosa becomes confused, as if struck by the beast\u2019s beauty, and loses the will to fight. It is still a subject of research, but it\u2019s thought that Pheromosa may possess some sort of organ able to produce a pheromonal substance previously unknown to science.\nWicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Pheromosa stores Z-Power , the same energy possessed by Totem Pok\u00e9mon , within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura .",

Its \"head\" is a white, brightly glowing electric spark with numerous points and no visible face. Below its head is a mass of black cables for its torso and limbs; there are white bands resembling zip ties throughout its body as well. Its arms have ties where its shoulders, elbows, and wrists would be. The upper arms have two cables, while the lower have three. At the ends of its arms are copper structures that resemble hands, each with six flat \"fingers\". The legs have ties at the hips, knees, and ankles and are composed of four cables fused together for the whole length. The feet have four toes possessing \"claws\" of exposed copper; each foot has two fused toes pointing forward and two separate toes pointing backward. Finally, its tail has three ties and four cables, one of them loose in two sections. The tail ends in what resembles a three-pronged plug.\nXurkitree live in another world named Ultra Plant . There, many have been seen unmoving, with their arms and legs stuck to the ground, similar to trees as they absorb electricity from the ground. Xurkitree vary greatly in size, from being a little bigger than a human to being the size of a mountain. Because this Ultra Beast reportedly raided a power plant, it is speculated to sustain itself with electricity. Witnesses claim that its entire body crackles with astonishing electrical power. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation , Xurkitree's most distinctive feature is an organ that can generate power. This UB's bodily makeup is highly reminiscent of electric wiring, thus enabling it to conduct electricity with great efficiency. It can discharge as much as a million volts of power at a time. When it begins to run out of power, it stabs its legs and tail into the soil, entering a treelike state as it absorbs electricity from the ground.\nWicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Xurkitree stores Z-Power , the same energy possessed by Totem Pok\u00e9mon , within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura . Xurkitree and Blacephalon have a rivalry with each other, often completing in contests to see who can shine the brightest as depicted in Twirling with a Bang! .",

It has a small, white head with a tiny mouth and a skinny neck with three segments. On top of its head is a gray structure resembling a hat with long, flowing hair underneath. The hair reaches midway down its body and is rimmed with bright blue. The \"hat\" has two small blue dots and four white spikes arranged in an X-shape. These spikes resemble decorative hair sticks . On the very top of its hat is a long gray horn similar to a drill bit . It has large, disembodied gray arms that resemble bamboo stalks. At the end of each arm is a ring of bright blue, fin-like projections and a collection of eight smaller, black bamboo shoots. Each smaller stalk has a bright blue ring with a small line extending back up the stalk. Its main body is conical and resembles a dress with four overlapping layers. The shortest and outermost layer is the shortest and appears metallic, while the inner layers are each a lighter shade of green, progressively longer, and seem to be cloth or plant material. Underneath all the layers is a white body with a light gray crisscross pattern covering it and a bright blue ring along the base. Below the dress is what appears to be a collection of eight black bamboo stalks. On the bottom of each stalk is a bright blue ring with a small line extending back up the stalk; this causes the stalks to also resemble solid rocket boosters . Celesteela is one of the heaviest Pok\u00e9mon , tying with Cosmoem .\nCelesteela live in another world named Ultra Crater . It appears to grow out of the ground like a plant in its homeworld, before exploding the ground around itself, and flying away into space for unknown reasons. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation , Celesteela's most distinctive feature is the energy that it stores within itself, a flammable gas that it can shoot from its two huge arms.\nThis is mostly used to propel itself in flight and for battle, but it has sufficient power and lift to even fly into space. Its bodily construction closely resembles that of a plant, and it absorbs nutrients from the soil.\nWicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Celesteela stores Z-Power , the same energy possessed by Totem Pok\u00e9mon , within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura . Celesteela's rocket thrust is powerful enough to destroy an entire bamboo forest. As seen in Rise and Shine, Starship! , Celesteela have a long lifespans, as one was buried in Alola , growing for over 200 years.",

Its head is folded slightly inside its body and has a four-sided star in the center, but no discernible facial features. Its head opens and closes similar to a paper fortune teller and seems to function as both an eye and a mouth. On top of its head are two short antennae or horns that are wider at the top. It has long, thin arms that resemble katanas with a yellow, sheath-like structure around the upper area. The sheath connects to a red, slightly raised hexagon on its torso. Extending up and out from the base of each sheath are three yellow projections that are nearly as long as its arms. Its legs appear creased with areas of red visible along the edges. Kartana's light, thin build makes it one of the lightest Pok\u00e9mon in existence.\nKartana live in another world named Ultra Forest . According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation , Kartana's most distinctive feature is its thin and razor-sharp body, of which every edge has as cruel a cutting edge as any well-honed blade. The edges on its arms are particularly in a class of their own. Any opponent who tries to attack it will be cut down with a single strike of its blades. Its thin body also allows it to evade attacks by dancing lightly out of the way. This is a very dangerous creature, considering its excellent offensive and defensive capabilities, but due to the nature of its body, it is also highly vulnerable to fire and moisture.\nWicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Kartana stores Z-Power , the same energy possessed by Totem Pok\u00e9mon , within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura . In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Sun & Moon episode Living on the Cutting Edge! , Kartana can open Ultra Wormholes and has the ability to speak the human language , albeit in reverse.",

            "description": "Guzzlord is a massive, black Ultra Beast . Its main body is primarily spherical with a large, yellow mouth in the center. The top and bottom of the mouth are lined with two rows of teeth; the front row is yellow, while the rear row is black. In the second row of the upper jaw, two teeth curve out of the mouth similar to tusks . The inside of its mouth is a bright blue and its throat is lined with small spikes; its large black tongue is also lined with small spikes. Additional tongues resembling long arms with pincers protrude from its lower jaw even when its mouth is closed. Just above its mouth are two glowing, blue eyes with a yellow, diamond-shaped marking between them. Above each eye is a single, bat-like wing with yellow along the upper edge. There are other small bat-like wings down the sides of its body as well. On the underside of its body are three, fin-like projections that curve up towards its mouth. Guzzlord's body is supported by a pair of thick legs, which have yellow zigzag markings across the knees and three claws each. On top of its body is a small, conical head with a second, smaller pair of glowing blue eyes. Four short horns with yellow tips form a ring around its head. On either side of its head is a larger, slightly curved horn also tipped in yellow. There is also a pair of arms on top of its body. Each arm has a hand with three yellow claws. A row of small spikes trails down its back and along its tail. The tail itself extends from the center of its back and resembles a medieval mace .\nGuzzlord live in another world known as the Ultra Ruin , which is an alternate universe's Alola , more specifically Hau'oli City . In the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Sun & Moon episode Battling the Beast Within! , it was revealed that Guzzlord is not native to the Ultra Ruin; it actually got there through an Ultra Wormhole and started devouring everything, leaving a barren wasteland behind. In the same episode, it was revealed that the second face above its maw is Guzzlord's weak point. Its body is said to feel like hard rubber. In order to eat, its tongue moves in a wave-like motion that pulls food towards its mouth. Guzzlord has an astounding appetite, devouring not only objects, but the ground, rivers, and even the seas. There have been reports of it eating mountains and buildings whole. Despite the massive amounts that it consumes, no droppings have been found, which may suggest its digestion is perfect, converting everything into energy in order to sustain itself . According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation , Guzzlord's most distinctive feature is its limitless appetite. It feeds without pause every moment that it is awake. It uses the two large tongues that protrude from its mouth to catch and devour everything in its path, be it organic or inorganic matter. And while it eats such an inordinate amount, Guzzlord excreta has never been discovered. It is thought that it might fully convert the things that it eats into energy for it to use.\nWicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Guzzlord stores Z-Power , the same energy possessed by Totem Pok\u00e9mon , within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura .",

            "description": "Necrozma is a vaguely humanoid Pok\u00e9mon whose body appears to be constructed out of a black crystalline material. The large protrusion attached to its head is its tail, which has a row of three large spikes along the top and is white in the back with a dark gray symbol resembling a eight-pointed star in the center. Its face is actually a prism-like object known as the \" brain prism \", which possesses a collection of multicolored shapes that resemble eyes. While absorbing light, this brain prism glows white. Its thin arms have disproportionately large hands with three claws. Jutting out of the back of each hand is a whitish crystal that darkens toward the tip, and each elbow has a hook-like spike. Two large spikes jut from each shoulder and there is a row of smaller spikes along each side of its body. Its feet have three hook-like toes each.\nNecrozma originates from Ultra Space and is capable of opening and traveling through Ultra Wormholes . This causes many to believe Necrozma is one of the Ultra Beasts, however, different accounts refer to Necrozma as a \"reminiscent of the Ultra Beasts\" and \"a creature almost like an Ultra Beast\". It once had the ability to give light in its original form, but lost this ability along its true form after being heavily injured by the Ultra Recon Squad 's ancestors in an attempt to steal its light; Professor Kukui and Lillie theorize that the Sparkling Stones and the Z-Crystals used to perform Z-Moves are fragments of Necrozma's body that it lost upon being injured and rained down into Alola . According to the Ultra Recon Squad, the light that radiates from Necrozma is the aura that surrounds the Trainer and Pok\u00e9mon while performing a Z-Move and the aura surrounding a Totem Pok\u00e9mon . This energy is consumed by Pok\u00e9mon such as the Ultra Beasts and radiated by Pok\u00e9mon such as Solgaleo and Lunala .\nNecrozma displays extremely violent behavior due to the constant, maddening pain it suffers in its incomplete state. Desperate for the light it requires to sustain itself and regain its original form, Necrozma steals light from other beings and places. This behavior caused it to be feared as and known as a \" pillager of light \" in ancient times. Its black coloration is a result of impurities building up within it as a result of its deep slumber. Necrozma can shoot powerful lasers using the power of a prism . It can also attack its foes with a large pillar of light . When Necrozma absorbs light from a world, that world becomes shrouded in darkness until the stolen light is returned as seen temporarily in Alola and in Ultra Megalopolis . In the anime, the Aether Foundation confused Necrozma for an Ultra Beast and gave it a code name, \" UB: Black \". Necrozma loves Necrozma Treats made by Snacksworth , who once encountered and roared loudly to intimidate it in the past.\nNecrozma is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Prismatic Laser and Photon Geyser . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Prism Armor as an Ability.",

            "description": "Magearna is a metallic, bipedal, and artificial Pok\u00e9mon that is made up primarily of spheres. Its head is a medium-sized sphere with a slight point in the back. Around Magearna's head is a gear with seven teeth, although the gear does not cover its chin. It has two large, rabbit-like ears with gold rims; a tiny nose and mouth; and light red eyes with pinkish ovals in the center. In the centers of the ovals are white crosses, and thin gold wiring encircles each eye with two small prongs similar to eyelashes. The rabbit-like ears appear to be two halves of a large disc held together by a hinge at the top. In the center of Magearna's body, there's an orb-shaped object called \" soul heart \", its true self. It's mostly light blue, but is divided by a thick gray band, in the front center of the band is a circular depression that is half-blue and half-pink. Above and below the depression, in the light blue portions, is a yellow, diamond-shaped marking. On either side of its upper body is a large, spherical shoulder with thin upper arms that lead to large, claw-shaped forearms and slightly pointed hands. Its lower body is a much larger sphere that resembles a ball gown . There is a pair of golden, wavy lines on each side of this sphere, which is divided down the front and back by a gray line. In the back, there is a solid gold ring with a hole in the center at the bottom of this line. The front has a gold ring as well, but it is broken at the top and bottom and has a shield shape in the center. Metal plates similar to the ruffles of a dress adorn the bottom of its lower body. It has two pointed legs.\nMagearna was created by a scientist as a gift to royalty, specifically to a king's daughter 500 years ago. The Soul-Heart in its chest is an artificial soul that was created by the scientist by collecting life energy from other Pok\u00e9mon. Due to Magearna's ability to feel other's pain, it will try as hard as it can to save injured Pok\u00e9mon. It can even perceive the emotions, thoughts, or feelings of other Pok\u00e9mon as well. When it falls asleep or when it is sad, Magearna can take on the appearance of a Pok\u00e9 Ball .\nMagearna is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Fleur Cannon . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Soul-Heart as an Ability.",

            "description": "Marshadow is a humanoid Pok\u00e9mon that appears to be made of smoky gray shadows. The area around its face resembles headgear, such as a helmet. On top of the helmet are two curled horns or ears with a wispy horn between them. Its eyes are orange-red with yellow pupils, and above each eye is a yellow, oval marking. Each arm has a small bump on the wrist. Around its neck is a smoky collar, and there is a trail of shadows on each foot.\nWhen angered or attacking, Marshadow's fighting spirit will begin to burn , causing it to turn into Zenith Marshadow . In this state, its headgear, wrist bumps, and collar flare up and resemble green and yellow flames. Marshadow's eyes also flare up when in this state, but do not change in color.\nVery few people have seen it, so its existence has been the stuff of legends and myths. A cautious Pok\u00e9mon, Marshadow sinks into the shadows to ensure it is not noticed while it observes its surroundings, much like how Gengar can. While hiding in the shadows of others, it can understand their feelings and copy their abilities. Through mimicry, it will eventually become more powerful than those it imitates. It can even learn the ultimate technique of martial arts masters it copies. As seen in the anime , Marshadow is also capable of causing nightmares.\nMarshadow is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Spectral Thief . Marshadow is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the Z-Move Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike .",

On its head are three spikes: one in the front and one on each side. A single gray needle protrudes from the top of its head and there are additional needles in the spikes on the sides of its head. It has oval eyes with a single eyelash-like spike above each; its mouth and eyes give off a cyan glow. It has a long, tapering tail with a single spine in the middle. While most of its body is dark purple, it has several fuchsia markings: at the tip of each head-spike, on its chest, on top of its head, and on its face.\nPoipole originates from Ultra Megalopolis in Ultra Space , where it is popular as a first partner Pok\u00e9mon in the games. However, Poipole originates from an unnamed world in Pok\u00e9mon the Series . It is capable of understanding human speech after spending enough time with humans. Poipole's large head is filled with a glowing, adhesive poison, which it can fire from the needles on its head. While spraying opponents with this venom, it laughs wildly. As seen in the anime, Poipole can also shoot a harmless multicolored substance as a way to paint, which can be also used to communicate with humans and Pok\u00e9mon . It's shown to have the habit to stand upside down and spin rapidly as a sign of happiness and excitement. Like all Ultra Beasts, Poipole stores Z-Power , the same energy possessed by Totem Pok\u00e9mon , within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura . In The Shape of Love to Come! , it is revealed that wild Poipole live in large numbers in huge nests that resemble wasp or hornet nests alongside Naganadel , serving as a queen.",

The upper chest, neck, head, and arms are light purple, while its waist is dark purple with a fuchsia stripe on each side. Each shoulder has a long gray spike and each hand has three pinkish-purple claws. Running down each side of its neck is a dark purple stripe, which connects and forms a loop on its chest. The lower area of the loop is fuchsia and has a short, downward extension in the middle. At the end of its long neck is its head, which has a long, spiked crest on the top. On the sides of its mouth are a pair of curved, gray spikes that act as mandibles. Its glowing cyan eyes are conjoined, rimmed with fuchsia, and have a spiky crest on either side, which gives them a visor-like appearance. A pair of light purple wings sprout from the center of its back. These wings have a single fuchsia claw at the joint, two spikes along the wing-arm and darker purple membranes with fuchsia markings near the spikes.\nNaganadel originates from Ultra Megalopolis in Ultra Space in the games. However, Naganadel originates from an unnamed world in Pok\u00e9mon the Series . The lower half of Naganadel's body houses its brain. It resembles a swollen wasp's abdomen and is filled with poisonous liquid. It is covered in stripes of light and dark purple and has three hollow stingers at the tip. The stingers are gray and have a fuchsia marking around them. The largest stinger is in the center; the other two are considerably smaller and sit on either side. These stingers are connected to its brain, so it will react violently if they are touched. Its main stinger can eject a luminescent, adhesive poison over a distance greater than six miles. Like all Ultra Beasts, Naganadel stores Z-Power , the same energy possessed by Totem Pok\u00e9mon , within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura . In The Prism Between Light and Darkness! , Naganadel is shown to be able to communicate with humans through telepathy and show them visions of the past. In the same episode, it was shown living in nests and leading large numbers of Poipole .",

The stones that form the legs and the top corners are slightly darker. When at rest, its legs fit into the corners of the structure. Its lighter gray stones have glowing blue lines on their sides, which are visible along its edges and underside. Each stone square has a black underside with a circular, glowing blue eye in the center. These eyes will turn red whenever angered or fighting. [1]\nAccording to Phyco , a single Stakataka comprises almost 150 individual lifeforms. Stakataka can plant itself on the ground to disguise itself or when sleeping. It can freely manipulate the stone lifeforms on its body to form legs and open up to let attacks through or trap foes inside it. Stakataka's legs are strong enough to break a tree in half. Like all Ultra Beasts, Stakataka stores Z-Power , the same energy possessed by Totem Pok\u00e9mon , within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura . As seen in The Long Vault Home! , Stakataka hates having anything on top of itself and will violently try to shake the object off. However, if someone can resist the shaking and successfully ride it, then it will calm down and they'll gain Stakataka's respect.\nLike Blacephalon , Stakataka's homeworld is one of the only worlds which is not seen and cannot be visited riding Solgaleo or Lunala in a Ultra Warp Ride .",

            "description": "Blacephalon is a colorful, humanoid Ultra Beast . Its slender torso and wide hips are yellow with alternating blue and pink stripes. There is a white sphere in the middle of its body and another on its back in place of a tail. It has thin arms with white frills on its wrists and teardrop-shaped hands. The right arm is pink, while the left is blue. Each arm has a spherical bulge near the shoulder. Its legs are shaped like white high-heeled boots with curled toes. Each foot has a sphere on it: blue on the left and pink on the right. Around its neck is a white frill with a hole in the center.\nBlacephalon's head is a white ball with a multitude of pink and blue dots, which are a collection of tiny sparks. On either side of the ball are stars that are blue on the outside, pink on the inside, and have yellow dot-like eyes on the center. The head is not attached to the body and can be removed for use as a weapon. As seen in Pok\u00e9mon Refresh , the color of the sparks and the color and shape of the stars change with Blacephalon's mood. It is known to trick its targets through the silly way it walks before blowing its head up without warning, shocking them in the process; it then steals their vitality to use as energy. Like all Ultra Beasts, Blacephalon stores Z-Power , the same energy possessed by Totem Pok\u00e9mon , within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura . As seen in Twirling with a Bang! , this Ultra Beast can freely move its head around easily and regenerate it after blowing it up. As depicted in the same episode, Blacephalon and Xurkitree have a rivalry with each other, often completing in contests to see who can shine the brightest.\nLike Stakataka , Blacephalon's homeworld is one of the only worlds which is not seen and cannot be visited riding Solgaleo or Lunala through Ultra Warp Ride .\nBlacephalon is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Mind Blown .",

            "description": "Zeraora is a bipedal, feline Pok\u00e9mon with primarily yellow and black fur. The fur is thinner and black on its lower legs, lower body, upper arms, and face, and is thicker and yellow everywhere else. There is also a zigzagging black stripe on each thigh and two more stripes on each forearm. There are small tufts of light blue fur on its chest and a longer tuft on its forehead. Zeraora also has a single, lightning bolt-shaped blue whisker on each cheek. A long, ponytail-like or tail-like bunch of fur extends from between its shoulders. Zeraora has large ears with black insides and blue eyes. Its forepaws have four clawed fingers and light blue pads, while its hindpaws have only three clawed toes.\nZeraora was born from an explosion caused by a bolt of lightning striking an erupting volcano. It lacks an electricity-generating organ, so it gathers and stores electricity from outside sources. This Pok\u00e9mon can create a very powerful magnetic field through the strong electric currents emitted from its paw pads. Using this magnetic field allows it to levitate and move at high speeds while airborne. Zeraora can travel as fast as a lightning strike. Its fur is known to stand on end whenever it is using massive amounts of electricity. Zeraora can tear its opponents apart with its high-voltage claws. Even if the opponent dodges, they can still get electrocuted by the flying sparks. Lightning flashes and thunderclaps can occur when Zeraora starts running.\nZeraora is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Plasma Fists .",

This sphere serves as its eye. It has a red tail that resembles an electrical wire with two tiny protrusions at the end. According to official concept arts, Meltan's liquid body is made of gallium , and it can cry gallium tears. Its arms can stretch to be longer or shorter. Meltan is one of the smallest Pok\u00e9mon, tying with Alolan Diglett and Klefki as the shortest Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nMeltan's body can corrode various metals, which it feeds on by absorbing them. The absorbed metals are circulated within Meltan's body to generate electricity, which it uses as an energy source. Meltan can also use this electricity to attack by firing it from its eye. According to Professor Willow , Meltan has been described in ancient texts in the same place the Mystery Box , was found. The Mystery Box was created by Melmetal 's followers to store away the Meltan created after its death, until one day, they could create a new Melmetal. At the end of a Melmetal's life span, it'll rust and fall apart, however its shards will eventually be reborn as Meltan. It is known to live in groups, until the day comes where one strong Meltan absorbs the rest of the group to evolve.\nAs seen in the Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Sun & Moon episode Show Me the Metal! , the hexagonal nut on Meltan's body can be removed. It has also been seen working in packs. Meltan can spin its head, creating a sound that calls others of its kind. Its head-spinning can also be used as a sign of affection. In Got Meltan? , it's revealed that it can be tamed if fed metal-like treats. In Living on the Cutting Edge! , Meltan is shown multiplying in numbers overtime.",

Many dark-gray hexagonal nuts are embedded in or attached to its body: one around each shoulder, one around the center of each arm, one in each hand, one in each foot, and a small light gray one in the center of its torso. A large, golden hexagonal nut encircles its neck and a smaller one acts as its head. Floating in its head is a small, dark gray sphere which may be oscillated. It has a small red tail resembling an electrical wire.\nMelmetal is a Pok\u00e9mon that has come back to life after 3,000 years. In ancient times, it was worshiped for its ability to create metal from nothing. According to Professor Willow , Melmetal lived in a secluded area deep within a wooded land that was full of sedimentary rocks rich with magnetite, and its shed metal was used by ancient people to create unique metal tools. The process of evolution has hardened its body, making it incredibly sturdy. However, it is still in a liquid state and has some flexibility, particularly in its heavy hex nut arms. Melmetal applies centrifugal force on its arms, allowing it to have the strongest punches of all Pok\u00e9mon. When it attacks, the nuts encircling its arms slide down as if to bulk up its fists. Melmetal is said to be created when one strong Meltan absorbs the group it lives with in order to evolve. When Melmetal reaches the end of its life, it will rust and break down into small shards, from which new Meltan will be born.\nMelmetal is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Double Iron Bash .",

            "description": "Grookey is a small, monkey-like Pok\u00e9mon with a green body, a brown tail, brown wedge-shaped ears, orange hands and feet, and an orange snout. Each of its hands has five fingers, while each of its feet has three toes. It has two large white eyes with black irises. A lime green mask pattern frames its eyes, and extends towards its forehead in a small bump above its snout.\nGrookey has two, leaf-shaped hair tufts that hold a stick on the top of its head. The stick used to be a branch from a forest where troops of Grookey lived, and it has a special power due to being exposed to the energy within Grookey's body. This energy helps Grookey's stick grow harder and more flexible. Besides using it when attacking, Grookey beats this stick rhythmically against the surfaces of all sorts of objects. This has been observed to cause grass to grow, and wilted flowers and leaves to seemingly regain their color. As depicted in the Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series episode Beyond Chivalry\u2026 Aiming to be a Leek Master! , it can even restore weakened plant-like Pok\u00e9mon such as Bellsprout . Grookey's green fur can create energy from the sunlight, similar to how plants use their green leaves to photosynthesize. Grookey is said to be full of boundless curiosity. It enjoys being in high places, and rhythmic things such as music or dancing. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy .\nIn Generation IX , Grookey and its evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Grassy Surge as an Ability .",

Its ears, arms, and tail are dark brown, and its two large eyes are yellow in color. It has dark green bands around its wrists and the stick it holds splits in two after its evolution, which it uses to hold up a tuft of leaves resembling hair on its head. When it removes the sticks, the leaves resemble a mohawk, with a dark green color on the ends. It has several sharp teeth.\nThwackey can use its two sticks to create a rhythmic beat. The faster a rhythm Thwackey creates, the more respect it earns from its peers. Often, when it drums out rapid beats in battle, Thwackey will get so caught up in the rhythm that it does not realize its opponent has been knocked out. This action will also cause Thwackey to even ignore its own Trainer\u2019s commands. To further develop its sense of rhythm, it constantly uses it in daily life. It can always feel a beat, and it walks while swaying back and forth to this beat, along with drumming with its sticks. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series episode A One-Stick Wonder! , Thwackey can groom its friends to cheer them up; this is its way to show friendship and trust.\nIn Generation IX , Thwackey and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Grassy Surge as an Ability .",

Its body consists mostly of shades of brown: light, tan brown on its forehead, chest, abs, and extremities; dark brown on its nose and triangular ears, as well as under its eyes; and medium, mud-like brown across the rest of its body, including its thick arms and legs. Its mouth, the tip of its nose, and its irises are orange, and its sclerae are white. Each of its upper arms have tan marks resembling bow-ties or butterflies, and it has two, diamond-shaped, tan marks running down its spine. The first, and larger, of the two marks begins around its shoulder blades, and the second, and smaller, mark begins below its rib cage. Rillaboom has a thick bush of green, leaf-like hair on its head, which cascades down its back; on its forehead, a single, vine-like hair, which closely resembles a music note, falls between its eyes and curls at the end, which sits to its nose's left side. On its hips on either side, it has green, belt-like adornments resembling four leaves in a row. Similar adornments with two leaf-like parts sit on its each of its shoulders near the clavicles; these adornments appear to be part of its hair when not attacking. On each of its wrists, Rillaboom has cuffs that resemble leafy crowns, with the peaks of the crown facing its hands.\nRillaboom always carries its signature drum with it on its back, and pulls it out when engaged in battle. This bass drum is crafted from a tree stump, with several thick branch stumps protruding from it, which form both the legs of the bass drum as well as mid and high toms. Rillaboom also carries two drumsticks in its cuffs and takes them out to beat its drum.\nBy drumming, Rillaboom can tap into the power of its special tree stump. The roots of the stump follow the direction of its drumming in battle. In a troop of Rillaboom, the one with the best drumming technique is the leader. This is how Rillaboom who challenged each other for leadership usually settles it through a drum battle. Rillaboom has a kind and calm disposition, valuing harmony within its group. It is very sensitive towards discord that could threaten the group's harmony, so it keeps a strict watch for such actions. Any offenders who drum up discord will be strictly disciplined by Rillaboom until they have learned their lesson. Due to its strong sense of unity, it will ferociously defend its allies from trouble. [1]\nRillaboom is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Drum Beating . Additionally, in Generation IX , Rillaboom and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Grassy Surge as an Ability .",

It has long legs with long feet, and similar yellow bands under each paw pad. It also has a small, white, poofy tail.\nScorbunny loves to run and is filled with energy. A warm-up run can cause the fire energy in Scorbunny to start coursing through its body, allowing it to fight at full power. It has a sac in its chest that contains fire energy, which it uses to generate heat from the special pads on the soles of its feet and nose, once it is ready to fight. The pads on Scorbunny's feet can get so hot that it is capable of using them to start small fires and burn opponents with a kick. The footpads of Scorbunny can deal heavy damage to opponents. It's shown in the Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series episode Best Friend...Worst Nightmare! that its heat pads can also thaw others out of ice. By using its powerful legs, Scorbunny can run and jump around its opponents to confuse and disorient them. It is a rare Pok\u00e9mon that is generally found under the ownership of trainers. According to Pok\u00e9mon Journeys , the soles on Scorbunny's feet are believed to bring good luck. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy .\nScorbunny and its evolutions are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Libero as an Ability .",

It has thick, fluffy fur in multiple colors: the fur on its head, hands, and small tail are grayish-white, while the fur on its body is primarily black, with red colorations on its arms, shoulders, and front half of its feet. It also has a fur collar that covers its neck and mouth like a balaclava , while its belly has tufts that are similar in appearance and function to jacket pockets. Raboot also has long ears, a few tufts of fur on top of its head, red irises, and a small yellow nose.\nRaboot's fur protects it from the cold, and allows it to use hotter fire moves, which it delivers through the yellow marks on its forehead and soles. Raboot takes great pride in its kicking moves. Raboot usually practices its footwork by kicking Berries from a tree's branches and then juggling them with its feet. While training its kicking attacks, Raboot tries to avoid using its arms, tucking them under its fur. This effectively prevents Raboot from losing body heat. Raboot is also capable of delivering powerful headbutts once its flames within heat up its forehead.\nRaboot and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Libero as an Ability .",

Cinderace has long white ears, the insides of which are yellow. Its white eyes, which have red-orange irises, have a deep navy pattern below them and yellow eyebrows above them. These eyebrows connect at the nose, which is red-orange, and form a \"crown\", which connects to the red-orange tuft of hair sticking out from its forehead, similar to a flame. It has two whisker-like tufts of white fur on each side of its face. Over each shoulder is a navy patch of fur, resembling a shoulder brace, which continues down the torso and connect at middle of the chest, creating what resembles a sports tank top. This navy-colored fur is also seen on its lower torso, creating what resembles a belt. The fur on its lower body is colored red-orange and resembles a pair of pants, with yellow pockets and ending in yellow tufts at the knees, with little tufts of fur on the backside of its thighs. Its ankles and feet are colored navy-blue and tipped red-orange at the toes. On the underside of each foot, there are three yellow dots of fur, from which it fires flames when attacking opponents.\nBy juggling a pebble with its feet, Cinderace can transform it into a burning soccer ball. By putting a spin on the ball, it can launch attacks that its opponents struggle to evade. The shots it fires can leave an opponent scorched . Cinderace has great offensive and defensive capabilities, being one of the best at explosive force, jumping ability, and kicking power. Due to its strong core and great balance, Cinderace can unleash powerful kicks from any position. In battle, it uses artful footwork to feint and throw its opponents off. This move allows Cinderace to blind its opponents and keeps them at bay. Cinderace can get pumped up with excitement should it get cheered on. However, it may get itself in trouble if it starts showboating. Despite easily losing its cool, it will follow the orders of its Trainer without flaw.\nCinderace is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Pyro Ball and Court Change . Cinderace and its pre-evolved forms are also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Libero as an Ability , which allows them to change their types. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series episode A Flood of Torrential Gains! , the tuft of red hair on Cinderace's head changes in color when it changes its type.",

It has the ability to change the patterns and colors on its body when touching water, allowing it to camouflage itself. Sobble is known to be very cautious in nature. Due to being a bit timid, when Sobble gets nervous or embarrassed, it secretes water from its body like sweat in order to disappear into its surroundings. If Sobble feels threatened, it will start bawling and spreading its tears around the area. These tears are said to be as potent as 100 onions, and can cause anyone near it to start crying uncontrollably, which it will use as a distraction in order to escape. By eating berries , it can shoot opponents down with bullets of water it spurts from its mouth. It has perfect aim with these water attacks.

            "description": "Drizzile is a slim, lizard -like Pok\u00e9mon . It is primarily blue with a white belly and a dark blue mark above it. It has lime green mitten-like hands and two-digit feet. On its face, it has small nostrils, half-lidded eyes with green eyelids, a thin line connecting its eyes, and a blue dot next to each eye. On its head are three hairlike structures, two dark blue and one purple. One of the structures sticks up like a cowlick. The other two droop over the face and cover one eye, resembling \"emo\" bangs. Inside its mouth, Drizzile has a long, mucus-coated tongue that can be used for catching prey or attacking opponents. Like its pre-evolved form, Sobble, it has a chameleon tail that swirls inward.\nDrizzile uses special pores in its palms to secrete moisture, which it forms into water balloons that it uses to attack. Drizzile is highly intelligent, capable of devising strategies or using its surroundings to enact hit-and-run tactics. However, it is also exceptionally lazy and prefers to not do anything unless it has to. It makes its home inside tree hollows or rocks. It is very cautious, and lays out traps everywhere around its territory to keep enemies out. Like its evolutionary relatives, it also has the ability to camouflage itself when wet. Drizzile typically moves on all fours, although it can stand and walk on two legs. Drizzile will use its long, slimy tongue to first attack its prey with blinding speeds before finishing it off with great skill.",

Its head, slender arms, and tail are light blue in coloration, with its tail having a thin dark blue streak following the ridge of the tail. This dark blue coloration is also seen at the tip of its head crest and on its slender torso, which continues down the backside of its legs until the bottom of the feet. The front side of its legs and feet are black, ending in three-pointed toes. Its hands are also black and have five fingers. Its eyes have yellow irises and white pupils, with a black lower lid and a yellow upper lid. Its membrane is also yellow; this membrane forms a thin, wavy, fin-like crest on its head, and connects to the back of its neck before falling over its back in a cape-like fashion. It has a white diamond-shaped patch of skin on its stomach.\nInteleon has many hidden capabilities. It has darkly colored nictitating membranes that allow it to analyze for an opponent's weak point. These special lenses can also detect body heat. Once Inteleon finds a foe's weakness, it will start attacking. This also helps it precisely shoot water from its fingertips at Mach 3. The membrane on its back is extendable and allows it to glide in the air. It also has a sharp knife hidden in its tail. Inteleon is highly intelligent, carefully thinking out strategies before entering combat to ensure a swift and decisive victory. It is also known to be quite chivalrous and is completely loyal to Trainers it sees as worthy. As seen in Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series , Inteleon can camouflage itself like its pre-evolved forms and has access to infrared vision . Despite Inteleon presenting itself as being a well-mannered Pok\u00e9mon, it still retains its lazy side from its pre-evolution. Inteleon will choose to slack off when its Trainer does not look at it.\nInteleon is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Snipe Shot .",

Its ears are similar in color to its tail, and they have orange insides.\nUsing its special cheeks, which can stretch to many times its normal volume, Skwovet can stuff a tremendous amount of food such as Berries . If it is feeling full, it can temporarily keep the extra food in its tail fur. Skwovet's habit of eating Berries nonstop has made it more resilient than it appears. If its cheeks are ever completely empty of Berries, it becomes very uneasy; it may even stuff its cheeks with pebbles if it can't find any Berries nearby. Skwovet will appear on farms, looking for more Berries to eat. When they are not eating Berries, they spit out the seeds in the rich soil in order to cultivate Berry trees. It has a habit of hiding and adding to its food storage, as it is always anxious about getting hungry. Gumshoos is its natural predator.\nSkwovet and its evolved form, Greedent , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Stuff Cheeks by leveling up.",

It has a darker brown area on its cheeks that can also be found on its chest, the underside of its tail, and the tips of its ears. Its fur is fluffy and messy. It also has orange freckles on its big cheeks and orange inside of its ears. Its eyes are a black oval-shape with white pupils, with a ring of light brown fur surrounding them.\nTrue to their name, Greedent are extremely greedy and gluttonous. Greedent constantly gathers Berries and stuffs them into its tail; it will run to gather Berries even if it's in the middle of a battle. It stuffs its tail with so many Berries, that these Berries fall out constantly, especially when it is hit or faints . It may also stash Bounsweet in its tail, as it considers the latter's sweet scent to be attractive. Dimwitted, Greedent will not often notice the loss of their food they store. Its sharp teeth are strong enough to gnaw through the strongest of Berry shells.\nGreedent and its pre-evolved form, Skwovet , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Stuff Cheeks by leveling up.",

It has red eyes with white markings under it, which helps Rookidee to intimidate fearful Pok\u00e9mon. It has small gray legs and feet, each with two toes on the front and one on the back.\nRookidee are feisty and territorial Pok\u00e9mon and will bravely fight against anybody, no matter how big and strong that opponent is. They are able to store some of their own energy after every battle, so they can grow a bit stronger even if they lose. Using their legs, they are able to jump nimbly from place to place to confuse Pok\u00e9mon bigger than themselves. Female Rookidee are fussier than the males, and will relentlessly attack anyone who dirties its wings. Rookidee preys on Grubbin .",

Due to its intelligence and flying skills, Corviknight serves a Flying Taxi service company called Galar Taxi, where it transports people from one location to another. Corviknight preys on Bunnelby , and has violent territorial clashes with Skarmory . In Paldea , Corviknight is constantly attacked by Tinkaton , who pelts it with rocks as it flies; thus, Flying Taxis in Paldea use Squawkabilly instead of Corviknight to avoid potential dangers.\nCorviknight is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Mirror Armor as an Ability .",

It has a small mouth and eyebrow-like markings that give it a perpetually surprised expression.\nBlipbug's second body segment is the same shade of blue as the top of its head, and resembles a collar. The third segment is thinner than the first two, and the two consecutive segments are thicker. Its last three segments are white, yellow, and blue respectively. Blipbug has two legs on both its third and fourth body segment; and it also has tufts of setae on its head, collar, and posterior. The setae on its collar are yellow and resemble a bow tie.\nA constant collector of information, Blipbug are very smart, but very weak. They are often found in gardens.",

Dottler's shell is made up of yellow triangular surfaces with blue circles around the points where the edges of the triangles meet. These blue circles constantly flash from top to bottom. The shell is so heavy, it prevents Dottler from getting food to eat and water to drink, leaving very small holes to breathe through.\nWhile growing inside, Dottler uses its shell to examine its environment, using its psychic powers to keep itself protected and gather information about its habitat until it evolves.",

Nickit also has tufts of furs on both sides of its head. It has a white belly and chest, its feet are black, and its tail is long with a black tip resembling a sack.\nA cunning thief, Nickit enjoys stealing food from others instead of spending their time finding food on their own. They have incredibly soft pads that compress lightly when in contact with the ground, allowing them to move silently without being noticed. They can use their tails to sweep their paw prints so it can be hard to locate them. It has a fierce rivalry with Purrloin .",

Its small head pokes out of the front of the wool, along with two short horns. Wooloo's eyes have yellow sclerae, black irises, and white, horizontal pupils. Two large ears are visible behind gray strings of wool that resemble braided pigtails. Wooloo's wool covers its entire body and most of its short hooved legs, along with a tail that is barely visible on its rear end.\nWooloo's fleece is extremely fluffy and can serve as a cushion, allowing it to survive even a fall from a cliff without any injuries. Its fur grows continuously, being able to fully grow back in just three months after it is completely shaved. The fur is a specialty product in Galar , being used for clothing and carpets; the clothing made from Wooloo's wool has a remarkable strength. If Wooloo's fur grows too long, it will be unable to move. Wooloo live in herds and are known to mimic the actions of their herd leader or Trainer. They have a friendly disposition and dislike conflict, and can escape from enemies by simply rolling away. Yamper is used to herd Wooloo.",

Chewtle has what appears to be a single toe or claw at the ends of each foot. It has an orange bulb on each of its cheeks and a short rock-hard orange horn on the top of the head, which it uses to stun its opponents and open them for attack. It has a pair of nostrils directly above its mouth, and a pair of small eyes with a black rim directly above that, with a single large brow, giving it an almost angry look.\nInside Chewtle's mouth is a dark orange tongue and a single large tooth, the latter of which it can use to bite down hard on targets, not letting them go. It can even hang on from low heights for a period of time using just its teeth. Chewtle snaps at anything in front of it because of an itch of its teething. Sometimes it bites at another Chewtle's horn, causing the two Chewtle to fight. There is a popular children's game involving Chewtle. The game involves children lifting Chewtle holding onto a stick and seeing which one can hold onto the stick the longest.\nPrior to Generation IX , Chewtle and its evolved form, Drednaw , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Jaw Lock .",

Its lower jaw is likewise pale yellow. Its head is boxy and has yellow orbs on its cheeks, and a yellow horn with two large sections coming off of it. There is a small hole on either side of its horn. Its eyes are white and somewhat rectangle shaped with small pupils. Its front legs have one large yellow protrusion each, and each of its feet have three white toes. Its tail is long and has two spikes coming off of it.\nDrednaw's sharp jagged fangs are powerful enough to chomp on rock, iron, and steel rods. It captures prey and fights opponents by chomping down on them. It can extend its neck very quickly to reach enemies that are farther away. Due to its well-developed muscles, it can move very fast despite its heavy shell. Drednaw are notoriously vicious to the point where it requires a skilled Trainer to fully tame and handle it. Some Trainers will release Drednaw into the wild once they find they are unable to handle it. Drednaw lurks along shorelines, biting on prey that approach its dwelling in search of drinking water.\nPrior to Generation IX , Drednaw and its pre-evolved form, Chewtle , were the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Jaw Lock .",

It has a yellow bolt-shaped tail and a heart-shaped pattern on its rear. Its four feet, underside, and parts of its face are white. Yamper's ears have a light green and yellow color on the inside. It also has a small yellow nose.\nYamper tends to be drawn to fast-moving things and will chase after people, other Pok\u00e9mon, or even vehicles. Yamper has an organ that generates electricity from the base of its tail when it runs. It cannot store the electricity it generates, so sparks of electricity can often be seen when it is running. In the Galar region , it is a popular choice for herding Pok\u00e9mon such as Wooloo . Due to its gluttonous nature, it will only assist people in exchange for treats. Joltik are often seen on its hindquarters, feeding on its static electricity.\nYamper is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Ball Fetch as an Ability .",

An outer ring of a light yellow is also around each eye. The inside of its ears is yellow with an outer ring of black. The desaturated green and yellow halves of its body connect on Boltund's shoulders, with the yellow part extending down in its front to cover Boltund's underbelly.\nBoltund can channel the electricity that it generates to its legs in order to keep them strong, boosting its strength and allowing it to run nonstop for three full days. It can easily run faster than 50 mph at top speed. It serves as the enemy of Thievul .",

It has a single orange-red eye that can light up and illuminate dark areas, while the rest of its body is black. It has a rugged exterior and lacks any limbs. Its lower body has a wheel-like leg, which it rolls on and uses for movement, in a similar fashion to a unicycle.\nRolycoly was first discovered around 400 years ago in coal mines. It races around on grassy plains and the rough, rocky terrain in coal mines and caves, burning through the coal that sustains it. Rolycoly's diet also includes grass that gets tangled in its leg. Until about 100 years ago, every household in Galar had a Rolycoly, using the coal that it drops for cooking and heating up homes. Rolycoly's popularity continues even into the modern-day, as it is used for outdoor activities. Dwebble is Rolycoly's natural enemy, as the former tends to think that Rolycoly is an inanimate rock to turn into a home.\nRolycoly and its evolved forms are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Steam Engine as an Ability .",

It has a large, coal-black body, with two legs and a pair of stubby arms, alongside two massive spikes atop its shoulders. It bears a head consisting of a pair of white eyes that can glow red and a mouth with serrated teeth. It carries a large amount of heated coal on its back.\nDespite its large and tough look, Coalossal has a peaceful disposition. However, it becomes enraged if the coal mines it lives in are vandalized, incinerating those who invade its territory with flames as hot as 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit (1,500 degrees Celsius). In battle, the coal on its head will burn bright red and radiate heat that sends sparks flying, scorching its surroundings. Coalossal intimidates its opponents by shaking its body and loosing coal from its back.",

Above its head are two large leaf-like eyestalks which house its two small black eyes. These eyestalks give the apple it lives in the appearance of having a stem with leaves. Applin also has two thin hairs on the tip of its tail, as well as two stubby forelimbs which are usually hidden inside its apple.\nApplin is both the lightest and shortest Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon, and also one of the shortest Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon. As soon as it is born, it burrows into an apple that looks like a Leppa Berry , which serves as a home, food source, and protection against preying bird Pok\u00e9mon. The apple is prevented from rotting thanks to Applin's body fluid, which also strengthens the fruit's rind. The flavor of the apple determines which evolution Applin will evolve into. If Applin runs out of apples to eat or if it is separated from its apple, its body will lose moisture, and it will become dehydrated and weak. Since Applin hides inside an apple, it is sometimes mistaken by the frugivorous Noibat for food. In Galar , it is a custom to give an Applin as a romantic gesture. Applin's evolution is influenced by different types of apples: Tart Apples , Sweet Apples , and Syrupy Apples .\nApplin, Flapple , and Appletun are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Ripen as an Ability .",

It can attack by spitting this acid at its targets. It is also able to disguise itself as an apple by folding its wings. Flapple repairs the apple on its body by using its body fluid. Flapple with clay-colored apples are generally stronger than its peers, and have won many battles.\nFlapple is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Grav Apple .

It is mostly green with a yellow underside and lower jaw, and it has an orange spot on its chest that resembles an apple core. It has a piece of an apple on its head worn as a helmet. Its leaf-like eyestalks usually droop down from under the apple helmet as though they were ears, but may be lifted up to reveal small beady eyes. It has black slits for nostrils on the tip of its muzzle. It has a large hump on its back with several overlapping stripes that resemble an apple pie's crust on top, along with a pair of red and green leaves. It has four short, bulky legs with paws, and a stout tail.\nAppletun's body is caked in sweet nectar, whose smell attracts Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon which Appletun preys on. However, Appletun's primary diet is sweet apples. In order to ward off other Pok\u00e9mon such as Lechonk from licking the nectar on its back, Appletun can spew a sticky nectar. The skin on its back is said to be tasty, and children used to eat it as a snack.\nAppletun is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Apple Acid . Appletun, Flapple , and their pre-evolution Applin are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Ripen as an Ability .",

It has oval green eyes with black pupils, each one surrounded by a brown spot similar to a sand stain and a brown protuberant ridge above it. Paired with its crooked downward mouth, its face is similar to a frown. It also has two big nostrils.\nSilicobra has a dark yellow pouch around its neck, which it uses to store more than 17 pounds (8 kg) of sand. The pouch gets more elastic with every time Silicobra sheds its skin. Silicobra collects sand by swallowing it and shoots the sand from its nostrils, an ability it uses to blind predators so it can escape by burrowing into the ground. It also burrows into the sand in order to ambush its prey. Because Silicobra's nostrils are specialized for shooting out sand, it has a poor sense of smell.\nSilicobra and its evolution, Sandaconda , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Sand Spit as an Ability .",

Around its neck is a dark greenish brown ring, which is its neck pouch. Its long body is coiled in a spiral shape. It has lime green eyes with red bags underneath them and a snout with two prominent nostrils and two fangs.\nSandaconda uses its inflated sand pouch to protect its head from harm. The pouch can store up to 220 pounds (100 kilograms) of sand, and is very elastic and thick to the point where a Durant 's pincers cannot harm it. Sandaconda can contract its body to spray the sand stored in the pouch through its nose with tremendous force, and its unique method of coiling allows it to blast its sand more efficiently. Some of the sand is combined with Sandaconda's own saliva to form sharp pieces of gravel, making it so dangerous that just coming in contact with it will cause lacerations. While Sandaconda may act tough and confident, it will become timid and cowardly the moment it runs out of sand. Sandaconda is known to eat Durant eggs.\nSandaconda and its pre-evolution, Silicobra , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Sand Spit as an Ability .",

It has a ruff of light gray feathers that goes around its torso and sticks out at the back, making it resemble a bib. It has a ruff of feathers on its head, with the largest clump pointing backward and being surrounded by small singular feathers. Its feet are black, webbed, and have three toes. Its wings seem to be perpetually spread outwards on its sides. Its tail feathers appear asymmetrical, with a slit between them on one side.\nCramorant is a gluttonous Pok\u00e9mon with an instinctive desire to swallow anything whole. It generally hunts for prey along riverbanks. Its preferred prey is Arrokuda , but sometimes it tries to swallow other Pok\u00e9mon such as Pikachu , attempting to spit them out if it realizes its mistake. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Cramorant is known to occasionally sleep while still swallowing its prey. The reason for this behavior is unknown to everyone, including the Cramorant itself.\nCramorant is quite strong, to the point where it can knock out some opponents in one hit. However, it is also rather unintelligent, forgetful, and bad at learning, as the energy used by its brain is minimal. It tends to focus more on battling, but sometimes it can't remember what it is battling mid-fight. Despite this forgetfulness, Cramorant never forgets Trainers that it trusts. However, it will try to attack its Trainer if they try to steal its food. [1]\nCramorant is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Gulp Missile as its Ability .",

It has two big black eyes and two small jaws pointing upward, the latter of which it is very proud of. It also has five fins scattered on its body; two pelvic fins, two anal fins, and one dorsal fin. This Pok\u00e9mon has two red spots, one behind each jaw, as well as three white scales on each side of its body for a total of six. Arrokuda lastly has three back fins on its tail resembling a ship propeller, starting off tan in color, but having a brown coloring on the end.\nCramorant is the natural predator of Arrokuda, and they grab Arrokuda in their mouth in battle if using Surf or Dive . Cramorant tend to spit out Arrokuda when attacked, however, causing the Rush Pok\u00e9mon to fly out and smack nearby opponents . In Paldea , Wattrel is Arrokuda's predator.\nArrokuda can only swim in a straight line. Should Arrokuda see any movement near it, it will charge ahead using its sharp pointed jaws; however, its poor eyesight causes it to miss frequently. Its movements also tend to become sluggish when it eats too much, which is typically when Cramorant and Wattrel appear to swallow it up.\nArrokuda and its evolution, Barraskewda , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Propeller Tail as an Ability .",

Its mouth has a noticeable under-bite, and two teeth on each side of its lower jaw can be seen when Barraskewda has its mouth closed. At each corner of its mouth are two dark spiral markings. Barraskewda's head has four protrusions extending backward from its sides, with a spike extending from the upper and lower part of each side. Its main body is tan in color, and across each side of its midsection it has a white line running down most of its length, with other white markings branching off, resembling fish-bones. A similar branching brown marking can be found running down the length of Barraskewda's dorsal side. It has two pairs of ventral fins and one dorsal fin located near the back of its body, along with four tail-fins that can rotate like a propeller, allowing Barraskewda to swim at high speeds. All of Barraskewda's fins are colored red. Its tail fins are attached to a white hub that connects to the brown rear section of its body, and the spines in its other fins are brown as well.\nBarraskewda's jaws are said to be as sharp as a spear and strong like steel. It propels itself up to speeds of 100 knots by spinning its tail, and uses that speed to ram into its prey, spearing it. It is able to leap out of the water and catch Wingull flying near the surface with its jaws. It is also known to compete with Finizen for food. The flesh of Barraskewda is surprisingly tasty.\nBarraskewda and its pre-evolution, Arrokuda , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Propeller Tail as an Ability .",

Its chest also has a pale lavender-white spot, heavily resembling a baby's bib. Its lower half is light purple with lines running down the sides, resembling a diaper and entirely covering its short, tapering tail. Its arms and legs have two stubby fingers and toes each, with pale white spots under the toes and palms. Toxel also has two white spots on its back, just below its head.\nToxel has two sacs inside its body, one to store poison and one to store electricity. It is able to drink dirty water and filter it into a poison that is harmless to it. By manipulating the chemical makeup of this poison, it can produce electricity. Toxel relays the electric poison through its skin. While the voltage produced by this electrified poison is weak, it can cause a tingling paralysis if touched. Toxel has a selfish nature and loves seeking attention.",

Both Amped Form and Low Key Form Toxtricity have purple-colored bodies and white eyes with black irises. Both forms also have four spikes on the back, four spikes on each wrist, and a crescent-shaped body part with seven spikes on the waist. Amped Form Toxtricity has a slouched posture. It has a yellow underbelly, yellow stripes on its legs, and yellow accents on its back, palms, and soles. It also has a yellow electric frill that extends from its snout to its neck. Two additional electric spikes protrude from its back. It has four horns: two smaller ones above its eyes, and two larger ones on the sides of its head. Six organs protrude from its chest. Amped Form Toxtricity are known to be short-tempered and extremely confident. This form aggressively attacks anything that makes eye contact with it. Low Key Form Toxtricity has an upright posture, with its neck standing tall. It has a light blue underbelly, light blue stripes on its legs, and light blue accents on its back, palms, and soles. It has a large fin-like horn in front of its face, and two smaller horns on the sides of its head. Its two light blue electric frills run from the base of its larger horn, and down to its neck. Four organs protrude from its chest. Low Key Form Toxtricity are known to be selfish and dismissive of others and have high regard towards their strength. Unlike its Amped Form counterpart, Low Key Form Toxtricity prefers to taunt opponents into fighting it when making eye contact with them. By clawing at the organs on their chests, both forms of Toxtricity can generate over 15,000 volts of electricity, as well as sound. The sounds they make resemble those of electric string instruments: a standard guitar for Amped Form, and a bass guitar for Low Key Form. Toxtricity chugs stagnant water to absorb the dissolved toxins, which it then breaks down in order to generate electricity. Toxtricity is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Overdrive, as well as the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Punk Rock as an Ability.",

Its thorax and head are mainly red-orange with dark brown sections across its body and yellow rings on its underside which can get very hot. Two fiery whiskers protrude from its face, and it uses its short stubby legs to move around.\nSizzlipede uses its coils to wrap around the prey before using its heated body to cook it. Sizzlipede, much like its evolved form Centiskorch, can generate heat using the flammable gas stored within its body. Once the prey is cooked to well-done, it will voraciously nibble at them piece by piece until the last morsel. Sizzlipede is related to Skorupi , with the two sharing a common ancestor. It is a similar species to Venipede , but often gets into fights with it whenever the two meet.",

The head has an orange mark in the shape of an exclamation point (\"!\") on the top, and two bright yellow eyes with triangular red pupils. It has orange-yellow flames coming out of its head and rear, simulating antennae and telson . Centiskorch creates flammable gases by fermenting the food in its body, and then burns these gases through the heat-generating organs along its underside. This results in the overflowing flames on either end of its body, which can reach temperatures of almost 1,500\u00a0\u00b0F (800\u00a0\u00b0C). As shown in the manga , the flames on its head can turn off.\nDue to its violent and belligerent nature, Centiskorch will attack anything that comes near it. When in battle, Centiskorch will rear up and use its long, hot body to attack, either by slamming its searing belly into opponents like a whip or constricting them with its body. Scolipede is the natural predator or prey of Centiskorch, depending on who wins the territorial fight.",

These large tentacles have rounded indigo bumps on each end, resembling boxing gloves. Each of the tentacles are lined with orange suction cups. Clobbopus's underside is indigo and contains its mouth, which is circular in shape and has two sharp beak-like protrusions.\nClobbopus has easily torn tentacles, which allow it to escape from predators; these tentacles can be regrown later. Its intelligence is comparable to that of a three-year-old human. It is a very curious creature and often investigates things by punching them with its tentacles. It normally lives underwater, but is known to surface onto land to search for food.",

The teacup that Sinistea lives in is a famous piece of antique tableware; seafoam green in color with gold rims and a lacy pattern that resembles a face. However, there are many forgeries in circulation.\nThe swirl pattern on Sinistea's purple body serves as a weakness. Should a Sinistea get stirred, the swirl will disappear and cause it to get dizzy. Sinistea can absorb the life force of anyone who drinks it. While it can wait patiently, most of Sinistea's opportunities end up being short, as it tastes so bad that it is spat out immediately. Sinistea inhabits hotels and homes. Poltchageist bears a resemblance to Sinistea, although the two species are biologically unrelated.",

Most of the teapots that Polteageist inhabit are forgeries, but occasionally an authentic one is found.\nThe black tea that composes Polteageist's body has a distinctly delicious flavor, but can cause strong chills when swallowed, and may also induce indigestion, stomach aches, and even death if drunk in excess. Only a Trainer it trusts is allowed to drink its tea. There are gourmets who drink Polteageist's tea everyday, showing no fear of the side effects. Polteageist attacks by shooting the tea at its enemy's mouth.\nPolteageist live in hotels and restaurants, disguising themselves as tableware and infecting leftover tea to create more of their own kind.

On the sides of its hair are two large, blue bulbous growths that appears to be held by pink rings. These growths resembles ponytails and Hattrem uses them to stand on. Hattrem has two, thin arms lacking any digits, and a white ovular spot on its chest. Its waist extends out into two lumps, with very small, light blue joint-less and digit-less legs. Its eyes have black sclerae and white pupils, with two pink dots for highlights that make its pupils vaguely resemble cartoon hearts.\nHattrem makes use of its ponytails as hands, pummeling its foes with them. One blow from these ponytails would knock out a professional boxer. Hattrem perceives strong emotions, including positive ones, as if they're really loud noises. Thus, Hattrem will violently silence anything nearby expressing or feeling strong emotions.",

            "description": "Hatterene is a small humanoid Pok\u00e9mon with a thin, white body. Its head is round and has a small mouth, narrow black eyes with white pupils, and two elliptical pink markings over each of its eyes resembling eyelashes or eyebrows. It has extremely long, layered, symmetrical hair, far longer than its body is tall; much like a cloak, the hair on its head drapes to the ground and swathes around it to conceal much of its true body, which is adorned by a pink semi-translucent dress that gives it a much taller silhouette, resembling that of a stereotypical sorceress or witch. This hair is colored in a gradient of baby-blue, pale pink, and white from its upper portions downwards. The hair above Hatterene's head is shaped like a wide-brimmed witch's hat with a conical shape serving as the crown of the hat formation. Extending from the pointed end of the hat is a single tentacle that ends in a pink bulb and a consecutive baby-blue bulb that has a trio of sharp claws, which can articulate in a manner similar to fingers, jutting out of it. Hatterene is a female-only species.\nHatterene has a solitary and reclusive nature, emitting psychic powers strong enough to cause headaches as a method to deter others from approaching and disturbing it. It has also been observed that it dislikes loud noises, tearing apart perpetrators with the claws on its tentacle as a result. As shown in the Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series episode Must Be Our Heroes and the Witch! , Hatterene plays with people's minds and creates illusions, deceiving them for its own pleasure. Due to its long hair obstructing its floating body, Hatterene's main forms of locomotion are levitation and short-distance teleportation. This Pok\u00e9mon lives in forests with no other living creatures nearby, and as such it is known as the Forest Witch.\nHatterene is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Magic Powder .",

This allows it to feed on negative emotions that it causes, sucking them through its nose. In contrast, Impidimp itself will become irritable if it has no negative emotions to feed on.

However, Morgrem's pupils are red instead of black, and its nose is longer. Morgrem has long, black hair with a bang that covers its left eye; the end of the hair is shaped like a pole arm .\nMorgrem lacks confidence in its physical strength, so it makes up for it with cunning and dirty tactics. It feigns surrender by going down on all fours to lure its opponents, before it stabs them with its hair. It tends to lure people into the woods where it lives. Like Impidimp, Morgrem feeds on negative emotions. Some people believe that Morgrem has the ability to make crops grow. Morgrem is very popular with people who have gloomy thoughts.

            "description": "Grimmsnarl is a green-skinned humanoid Pok\u00e9mon mostly covered in long, dark purple hair, except for part of its face, its abdomen, its feet, and a small red patch on its chest. Most of its hair wraps around its body, except for a lock on each side of its face, a few spikes raised on its shoulders and some locks draping from behind its legs resembling a cape. While being bulkier than its pre-evolutions, Grimmsnarl is more slender than it appears to be, with its hair giving the appearance of a muscular body. Grimmsnarl's hair works like muscle fibers and helps enhance its strength. Grimmsnarl is able to move its hair, and uses them to ensnare opponents in a tentacle-like fashion. By using its hair in this way, Grimmsnarl is powerful enough to overwhelm Machamp .\nLike its pre-evolutions, Grimmsnarl has tall, large crescent-shaped ears with red insides, as well as a long, sharp, upturned nose with a single long red nostril. It has a blue tongue and six teeth protruding from its mouth: two pairs of flat front teeth on each jaw, and a pair of sharp fangs on the upper jaw. It has white eyes with red irises, black pupils, and gray eyelids. Its face ends in a small pointy chin. Grimmsnarl's hands and feet have three pointed digits each. Grimmsnarl and its pre-evolutions are male-only species. It lives in the forests, and retains the troublemaking behavior of its pre-evolved forms.\nGrimmsnarl and its pre-evolved form, Morgrem , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move False Surrender . In Generation IX , Confide is also one of its signature moves. In Generation VIII , this was also true for Spirit Break .",

It has a thicker coat of gray fur around its forearms and lower legs, as well as around its back, and most of its chest like a vest.\nIt is said that Obstagoon's evolution is the result of the Galarian Linoone 's survival instinct being honed from competition and harsh conditions of the Galar region. While combative to the extreme, it doesn't attack often, as it prefers taunting an opponent into attacking first. When that happens, it uses its signature move Obstruct , in which it threateningly crosses its arms and lets out a staggering yell, so loud and obnoxious that it would cause any opponent to flinch. Obstagoon is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Obstruct. By using the move, it skillfully throws opponents off guard before countering with its sharp claws. Obstagoon are also known for their duels against Pangoro .",

The lower body of Cursola resembles that of Galarian Corsola, albeit broken apart to reveal an ectoplasmic \"body\" which has taken the shape of a ghost. This ectoplasm surrounds Cursola's core, which is a white sphere with a face like that of Galarian Corsola, and has an oval-shaped opening with three inward-facing notches where the core is. Two half-circle openings similar to eyes are located above Cursola's core. Together, the three openings resemble a screaming face with a sad or pained expression. On its ectoplasmic body, two small branches below the core serve as its arms and one small branch on its forehead serves as a horn. It has three long branches each on both sides of the head, and three more on its lower back. All of its branches can split apart when it attacks.\nCursola's overflow of ectoplasm is the result of a long and continuous process of absorbing spirit energy from other creatures. The ectoplasm causes anyone who touches it to become stiff like stone. Cursola can be seen wobbling while wandering, possibly because it enjoys being so light-weight. Cursola are known to gather together under a full moon, and send their branches into the sky. The reason for this behavior is unknown \u2014 one hypothesis suggests that it is a ritual of release, shedding the energy they've gathered from others; while another hypothesis posits that this is a form of communication between the Cursola.

It has a crest on its head, consisting of three feathers standing upright. Its wings serve as humanoid hands, with the feathers at the end resembling fingers. It carries a massive leek in two parts, wielding the long, sharpened stalk as a lance and using the hard leaves as a shield. It is said that Sirfetch'd's evolution was attained by Farfetch'd who have experienced and survived many battles. Sirfetch'd is known to be calm and collected, preferring to fight fairly. Due to its noble nature, Sirfetch'd is often chosen as a motif for paintings; one famous painting in the Galar region shows a Sirfetch'd dueling with an Escavalier. The leek it carries is its most prized possession; it is used as both weapon and food, and maintained for many years. Once the leek finally withers, Sirfetch'd will retire from battle for good.",

It has yellow eyes and a moustache that covers its mouth. Its black-and-white torso resembles a coat or tuxedo and a face, with yellow shirt studs for its 'eyes', a red lump as its 'nose', and a white cummerbund for its 'mouth'. While its actual face remains almost expressionless, the features on its torso will change to convey emotions. Its lower body is blue and it has black and blue feet that resemble large shoes, presumably capped with ice. It has black spherical shoulders and blue arms with white, mitten-like hands. It always carries a blue formal cane made of ice. Mr. Rime is highly skilled in tap dancing and waves its ice cane while it moves gracefully. It is popular due to its amusing movements and has been known to influence the Mime Jr. of the Galar region to learn its dancing steps, leading them to evolve into Galarian Mr. Mime. It can release psychic powers through the pattern on its belly. Mr. Rime and its pre-evolution, Galarian Mr. Mime, are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Screen Cleaner as an Ability.",

Two sections of the slab at the upper left and upper right side, along with a piece bearing the serpent's head and a small piece bearing the tip of the image's tail, have broken off and are held in place by shadowy black tendrils that form its arms, neck, and tail respectively; the \"tail\" fragment also resembles the piece carried by Galarian Yamask . It has five black fingers on each hand, which extend from the ends of the fragments forming its arms. It has a single purple eye located in the same spot as the painting's eye. Runerigus seems to be distantly related to Cofagrigus .\nRunerigus was formed from a painting imbued with an ancient curse, which was activated by absorbing the spirit of a Yamask and brought the painting to life. Anyone that touches its shadowy body will have the memories behind its painting's creation forced onto them.\nRunerigus and its pre-evolution, Galarian Yamask , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Wandering Spirit as an Ability .",

It has completely white eyes.\nMilcery is born from sweet-smelling particles in the air. When a Milcery absorbs sweet aromas, its body begins to swell. Milcery will start to deflate when its energy level begins to drop. When Milcery is attacked, it will tackle the foe first before covering them in cream. Once the opponent is either blinded or astonished by delicious cream, Milcery will then flee. It is rumored that patisseries visited by Milcery are guaranteed success and good fortune.

It consists of five troopers and a leader, known as \"the brass\". Falinks usually march in a single file line headed by the brass, giving their formation the appearance of a caterpillar. This formation is known as the Column formation. However, Falinks occasionally break their formation to attack.\nThe six members rely on teamwork as their strategy to win battles, and constantly change formation when they fight. The five troopers follow their brass loyally, and the brass's orders are considered absolute by them. Falinks are capable of fitting into small holes, as shown in Route 8 , where they can be seen marching and charging through small caves and crevices. In Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series , the six individual Falinks are shown to occasionally stand upon one another to execute certain moves. In Pok\u00e9mon UNITE , it is shown that the brass may also dispatch troopers to attack on their own, with this strategy being known as the Dispatch formation.\nAn individual Falinks trooper has a black, spherical body with two stout, trunk-like legs. They also have blue, ovular eyes which can either be interpreted as being white or glowing slightly from their dark body. Each trooper has a golden, armored shell resembling a Spartan helmet that covers their dorsal half. This shell is topped with a red horn that continues into a small crest. The lateral sides of the trooper are protected by two horned plates resembling shields. Each of these shields features a red, central horn ringed in white. Each trooper also has a small red horn on their posterior resembling a tail.\nThe Falinks brass is the largest, strongest, and most intelligent out of the six members. It has a larger crest with an extendable horn it uses to attack and issue orders. The horn is supported by a golden anterior strut absent in the troopers. The brass's golden shell extends to the ventral half of its body. Unlike its troopers, the brass's lateral shields can be opposed. The brass's shields are often chipped or nicked. When Falinks is marching in formation, the brass holds its two shields in front of its face.\nFalinks is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move No Retreat .",

As its food digests, Pincurchin generates electricity, which it stores in its spines. If one of the spines gets broken off, it will continue to emit electricity for approximately three hours. Pincurchin's yellow mouthparts, in contrast, do not conduct electricity. Pincurchin has a timid and easily frightened disposition and will discharge electricity when startled.

Snom's internal organs amplify the cold air from the snow it consumes, which it uses to create the spikes on its back. The more snow it eats, the larger and more impressive the spikes grow. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Camp , Snom are known to be voracious eaters, only being satisfied with heaping amounts of food. If it is startled, it will quickly burrow into the snow.\nSnom and its evolution, Frosmoth , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Ice Scales as an Ability .",

On top of its body are two, smaller rectangular stones giving it the appearance of a hat. Its arms are made up of three chained, square rocks alternating between gray and dark gray. It has two large, gray legs resembling the standing stones on Turffield , each of which weighs over 400 pounds (200 kg). These legs are brown on the lower half, and have gray crosses. In the TCG , a resting Stonjourner is shown to be able to detach and rotate its legs.\nOccasionally, Stonjourner will unleash a burst of speed to perform dynamic feats with its legs. Most of the time, it stands in a field watching the sun's progress, preferring a quiet life. Curiously, once every year on a certain day, groups of Stonjourner gather from all over to form an evenly spaced ring or circle. No one knows the reason why they assemble in this formation, leading to many theories involving the position of the sun, the earth's energy, and other factors. Another curiosity is that the elemental composition of the rocks that form Stonjourner's body were found to match the bedrock of a land far away from its native habitat. Stonjourner primarily makes its home in grasslands.\nStonjourner is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Power Spot as an Ability .",

This ice cube is a light blue, with specks of white seen dotting the surface of it. Two oval-shaped eyes and a beak are seen on the front of the cube. It also has a long, antennae-like hair sticking out of the cube. Eiscue's body is black and white with light blue accents around its belly. It has two flippers and yellow feet, with three toes on each. Its true face within the ice is colored light blue with two white eyes, black eyebrows and a white beak, and has a worried expression to it. Eiscue comes from extremely cold areas. It can produce cold air from inside its head to create ice to protect its head from heat. The ice, however, is not very durable, as a strong blow can shatter it, after which it goes on to create new ice. The ice starts to form around its hair first. Eiscue is easygoing by nature. It is a poor swimmer, and is often seen aimlessly floating in the ocean with just its ice-covered head floating on the surface, occasionally washing up on distant shores. It never panics or gets upset whenever it ends up in a new land, instead continuing due to its ability to adapt.The ice on Eiscue's head has a mild salty taste, presumed to be caused by it having floated in the oceans. When the weather is hot, groups of Eiscue will cool each other down by pressing their ice cube heads together. Eiscue's hair is connected to the surface of its brain, which then chills the air around it when it has something on its mind. Eiscue also uses its hair to catch prey in the sea, by forming ice balls at the tip and dipping it into the water like a fishing line.",

            "description": "Morpeko is a short, chubby rodent Pok\u00e9mon who can change forms via its signature Hunger Switch Ability, which alters its appearance. The features shared between the two forms are short, stubby arms and feet; a pair of pink circular cheek pouches; a very tiny nose; two almond-shaped ears with a single fur tuft under each; and a primary body color separating two areas of fur which cover the arms, ears, cheeks, and eyes, and zigzag inward towards its face, stopping at the waistline. These fur patches form pockets that it can store seeds in. On the back of its body is a pattern resembling a Pikachu's tail that extends from the bottom half of its fur. In its Full Belly Mode, its body is a creamy yellow, and its eyes are circular and black with large white pupils. The fur on the left side of its body is black, and on the right side, it is brown. A single bucktooth can be seen protruding from its smiling mouth. While in its Hangry Mode, Morpeko's primary body color turns purple, its eyes become downward-slanting red semi-circles, and its right-hand patch of fur turns from brown to black so that it matches the other side. Its mouth is also constantly formed into an angry snarl. Morpeko carries around Berry seeds that have been electrically roasted in its pockets. It treats the seeds with care as if they were precious treasures until it eats them as a snack. The seeds it stores keep Morpeko's hunger at bay due to its small stomach. Unless Morpeko continues to eat its stored seeds, it will become instantly hungry. Morpeko generates electricity with its cheek sacs; this process consumes a lot of energy and causes it to become hungry no matter how much it eats. By experiencing prolonged hunger, the hormones in Morpeko shift in balance, and its fur color changes. As a result of intense hunger, Morpeko becomes aggressive, driven into committing all kinds of evil deeds and enacting extreme violence until their hunger is satisfied. The energy within its cheeks also changes from Electric-type to Dark-type.Hangry Mode Morpeko has a wild, brute-like nature while in this form. However, as seen in the Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series episode Crowning the Chow Crusher!, once Morpeko is fully fed, it will refuse to eat more food and attack anyone who tries to feed it.",

Cufant has a bulbous dome atop its head and a short bobtail.\nMost of its body is a tangerine color, but its ventral side is lighter. It's also covered in patches of green where rain has tarnished the copper in its skin. It has two such patches at the base of its trunk, and a dappled tarnish pattern on its domed skull and dorsal side. The tip of its trunk and the rims of its nails are also tarnished green, and it has a green patch behind each of its eyes.\nCufant is said to be tremendously strong, carrying loads of over five tons with minimal effort. Cufant and Copperajah are docile in nature, and were introduced to the Galar and Paldea regions to assist with heavy labor. It travels in herds, searching for food in caves in the morning.",

Untarnished copper accents cover most of Copperajah's face, and pattern its ears, feet, trunk, and back. It has short, blunt tusks and a long, broad, muscular trunk that ends in three claw-like protrusions. It has three raised, white ridges on the dorsal end of its trunk, and several rocky protrusions on the dome of its skull.\nDespite being found in the Galar and Paldea regions, Copperajah and its pre-evolved form Cufant are not native to either of them, having been imported from another region to work with humans. It also works with other Pok\u00e9mon, such as Gigalith , in construction sites and mines. Copperajah's tarnished skin is resistant to water. It has enough physical strength to pull an airplane, and its trunk is strong enough to crush boulders into powder. It lives in social herds and has a boastful disposition; the more vibrant its skin is, the prouder it will be.",

            "description": "Dracovish is a hybrid fossil Pok\u00e9mon . It consists of the head of the fish fossil and the back legs and tail of the dino fossil; the head appears to have been mounted on the tip of the tail. The tail region ends abruptly at a circular cutoff. Dracovish's legs are mostly green with two pink stripes. The feet have three red claws. The neck is also mostly green but has a red stripe going up the middle. The stripe is lined with three curved spikes on both sides. Dracovish's head is roughly circular with a rounded triangular plate on the top. On the plate is a red and white region that extends between the eyes. Its mouth has three sharp teeth in the middle. Its eyes are round and have black rectangular pupils. Two fins protrude from the bottom of the jaw.\nDracovish is said to have been the apex predator of its time due to its powerful legs and jaws, and the ability to run at speeds exceeding 40 mph (60 km/h). However, it could not breathe unless it was underwater. Dracovish allegedly went extinct due to overhunting its prey, though this is likely not the case due to it being combined from two separate Pok\u00e9mon that each had their niches before going extinct. As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series episode On Land, In the Sea, and to the Future! , Dracovish can run very fast when underwater. It has also been shown that Dracovish can awaken a dormant power from within itself that causes the spikes on its chest to become surrounded by a red aura. When in this state, the spikes can be used to bind targets or jab them.",

Duraludon's head has a small red section and multiple slits on it. It also has yellow eyes with green pupils, and it appears to be permanently scowling. It moves its upper jaw when opening its mouth. Duraludon armor has a smooth feel, similar to a mirror finish.\nDuraludon's body is made of strong, but surprisingly light, special metal. The armor is both durable and resistant to scratches. Weighing only 88\u00a0lbs. (40\u00a0kg), it can move very fast. However, its body can easily rust, so it lives in caves and mountainous areas and avoids rain. The metal body also has a risk of overheating, so it vents the heat out through the slits inside its tail. It uses its arms, which have slightly different shapes from each other, to grind down rock surfaces for food. Duraludon has a rivalry with Tyranitar , which it shares its habitat with, and they often battle each other in the mountains of Galar . It mainly resides in caves and mountains within cold areas.\nDuraludon and its evolved form, Archaludon , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Stalwart as an Ability .",

Its head is a darker green, with yellow eyes, pink eyelids and gills, and large horns tipped with pink. Its serpentine body has two long front limbs, as well as a darker green stripe near its tail with three fins surrounding it.\nDreepy are reborn ghosts of a prehistoric species that once lived in ancient seas. It generally retains the same behaviors it had when it was alive, as it tends to wander the locations where it once lived, as well as biting at Clauncher as if to eat them. Dreepy are exceptionally weak in combat, so much that on its own, a mere child could defeat it. However, it has the potential to become much stronger and evolve if it has friends to help it train. In the evening, groups of Dreepy fly at high speeds across the seas, poking at other Pok\u00e9mon underwater for fun.\nDreepy can often be seen fighting alongside its evolutionary relatives Drakloak and Dragapult . The former takes care of Dreepy until it evolves, while the latter is known to launch Dreepy at Mach speeds , which the Dreepy enjoy.",

It has short, stubby arms and legs and a long tail.\nDrakloak is capable of flying at speeds greater than 120 mph (200 km/h). It carries a Dreepy on its head, which it takes care of and fights alongside until the Dreepy manages to evolve. If it lacks a Dreepy to care for, it will become uneasy and desperately try to find any Pok\u00e9mon to serve as a substitute to take care of. Drakloak attacks by firing energy blasts from its lungs. If it is defeated in battle, its Dreepy will wander off.",

It has a triangular, wing-shaped head; a relatively short body; and a long, laterally flattened tail similar to a newt's.\nThe dorsal side of Dragapult's flattened head and the anterior half of its body are a dark navy color, which fades to a teal on its posterior end and tail. The lateral, wing-like crests of its head are pink. The ventral portion of its head and body are a light yellow-tan color, and its belly is marked with three pink chevrons angled toward its head. It has four hollow, triangular horns and narrow yellow eyes with pink eyelids. Its limbs are relatively short and thin, and are clawed. The claws on its forelimbs are pink. Dragapult's tail becomes transparent and ethereal toward its tip.\nDragapult and its evolutionary line are the ghosts of prehistoric aquatic Pok\u00e9mon. Dragapult carries a pair of Dreepy inside its horns, which it will fire at its opponents like supersonic missiles during battle. It's said that the Dreepy it carries greatly enjoy being sent flying toward opponents at immense speeds. This is evident by the fact that Dreepy always gather around the fastest Dragapult in their group. By focusing its mind, Dragapult can also turn itself, as well as the Dreepy inside its horns, invisible. Much of Dragapult's behavior beyond this, however, remains a mystery.\nDragapult is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Dragon Darts .",

Two pink fringes of fur are present on its back. Battle scars are visible on its sides, and part of its left ear is missing.\nIt is believed to be either the elder sister or rival of Zamazenta . In the past, Zacian was feared and respected by the people of Galar . 3000 years ago, it worked together with Zamazenta and two young humans to save the region from Eternatus and the Darkest Day it created, defeating the Gigantic Pok\u00e9mon and forcing it back into slumber, which also caused pieces of its body imbued with its power to rain down throughout Galar in the form of Wishing Pieces and Wishing Stars . It can also turn itself into a statue and slumber for eons alongside Zamazenta in the Slumbering Weald . Zacian can also cast illusions, including a projection of itself, even while it slumbers. Additionally, it is capable of flying. Even though it is not capable of Dynamaxing , Zacian may still go berserk when bombarded by Galar particles . As years passed, both Zacian and Zamazenta were forgotten by history, however, Professor Sonia proved their existence by writing her first book: \" Galar: A History \", which details the discovery she and the player had in Stow-on-Side .\nZacian is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Intrepid Sword as its Ability .",

Its tail and ponytail are a deep blue; it also has deep blue accents on its neck and forelimbs. Its body is covered in battle scars and part of its right ear is missing. Its head and neck have thick fur resembling a shield.\nIt is believed to be the younger sibling or the rival of Zacian . In the past, Zamazenta was feared and respected by the people of Galar . 3000 years ago, It worked together with two young humans to save the region from Eternatus and the Darkest Day it created, defeating the Gigantic Pok\u00e9mon and forcing it back into slumber, which also caused pieces of its body imbued with its power to rain down throughout Galar in the form of Wishing Pieces and Wishing Stars . It can also turn itself into a statue and slumber for eons alongside Zacian in the Slumbering Weald . Zamazenta can also cast illusions, including a projection of itself, even while it slumbers. Additionally, it is capable of flying. Even though it is not capable of Dynamaxing , Zamazenta may still go berserk when bombarded by Galar particles . As years passed, both Zamazenta and Zacian were forgotten by history, however, Professor Sonia proved their existence by writing her first book: \" Galar: A History \", which details the discovery she and the player had in Stow-on-Side .\nZamazenta is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Dauntless Shield as an Ability .",

            "description": "Eternatus is a gigantic, draconic alien Pok\u00e9mon . Its body has a vaguely draconic shape and skeletal appearance, and it is largely dark violet with red highlights. Its main body and tail are long and thin and resemble a spinal column, and it has four small, thin limbs ending in claws formed from spindly appendages attached at right angles. Its torso is formed from a cage of appendages resembling ribs, and inside is a glowing pink core that serves as Eternatus's energy source, absorbing energy to sustain it. Its head is triangular and has a pair of white, eye-like markings in the form of three connected circles, as well as a spindly lower jaw with several diamond-shaped teeth. Over its head is a translucent red film held between five long spikes extending toward its body's rear. It also has a pair of thin tendrils extending from its back, formed from numerous triangular segments. Eternatus's gigantic size makes it the tallest known Pok\u00e9mon with the exception of Dynamax and Gigantamax Pok\u00e9mon.\nEternatus serves as the source of the Dynamax phenomenon in Galar due to its power leaking out in the form of Galar particles following its defeat 3000 years ago by Zacian , Zamazenta , and two young humans . After it reawakened in the present day, Eternatus's core needed to reabsorb the Galar particles in order to remain active, apparently due to its past defeat weakening it. In Pok\u00e9mon Masters EX , Eternatus can replace Galar particles by absorbing sync stone energy in massive amounts instead. Its core can also project its absorbed energy into massive blasts fired directly from its center. These blasts are capable of causing more damage to Dynamax and Gigantamax Pok\u00e9mon. Pieces of its body imbued with its power rain down throughout Galar in the form of Wishing Pieces and Wishing Stars . When it is awake, Eternatus causes a phenomenon dubbed the Darkest Day , in which the massive quantities of Dynamax energy it unleashes cause Pok\u00e9mon to Dynamax and rampage uncontrollably. It can also sometimes keep other Pok\u00e9mon from Dynamaxing in its presence. Despite this connection to the phenomenon, it cannot Dynamax itself, as its Eternamax form replaces that effect.\nAs depicted in the Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series episode Sword and Shield: \"From Here to Eternatus!\" , Eternatus can use its energy core to target a Pok\u00e9mon and force it to Dynamax or Gigantamax. Pok\u00e9mon the Series also elaborates upon its ability to block other Pok\u00e9mon from Dynamaxing, depicting this power as Eternatus absorbing the Galar particles in the area to make them unavailable for other Pok\u00e9mon to use. The same episode also shows that Eternatus can forcibly revert other Pok\u00e9mon that have already Dynamaxed or Gigantamaxed through the same process. In Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series , Rose coined Eternatus's name, but in the past, it was known as the Darkest Day , as referred to by the people of Galar who feared it 3000 years ago.\nAs seen in chapter Oh My!! The Disappearance of Henry of the Pok\u00e9mon Adventures manga , Eternatus's poison has the capability of altering people's behavior, making them violent and selfish, as shown with Henry after he touched the poison. As later mentioned by Calyrex in PASS38 , both met during the first Darkest Day.\nEternatus is an extraterrestrial Pok\u00e9mon that came to the Pok\u00e9mon world inside an asteroid around 20,000 years ago. It's implied by Peonia that Eternatus's asteroid (referred to as a Wishing Star ) landed at the Crown Tundra , specifically in Slippery Slope , creating a cavern called the Max Lair .\nEternatus is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the moves Dynamax Cannon and Eternabeam .",

The patch of fur on its forehead partially covers its black eyes, and has two black downturned eyebrows on top. Additionally, there are two white ribbons of fur located behind its head. Kubfu builds up power and fighting spirit by pulling on these ribbons. Its nose is black and it has a perpetual frown. It has black claws and toes, the latter of which are shaped like triangles. Its tail has a black, spiky appearance.\nKubfu works hard to train both body and mind, even using its defeats as a motivation to grow even stronger. It has a unique organ that allows it to create \" fighting energy\" in its lower abdomen through special breathing techniques and intense focusing. Wild Kubfu live in mountainous areas far away from the Galar region , although they lived in the region at some point. According to historical texts, Kubfu used to travel to uncharted lands with people as they went to trade or explore. Records suggest that the Kubfu living in faraway mountains in the present day, may have descended from the Kubfu that became naturalized in the distant lands they visited in the past . It has been referred to as the \" secret armor \" of the Isle of Armor 's Master Dojo , being gifted by Mustard to the one who pass the dojo's three trials. The move it masters by reading one of the special scrolls in one of the Towers of Two Fists will determine which fighting style it takes after evolving. While it can be timid, it can become more brave and confident once trained up. Kubfu loves Kubfu Treats made by Snacksworth , who once encountered and trained with it in the past.",

The fur on Urshifu's head is spikier and flares into a flowing white and black headband. The backs of Urshifu's hands, its knuckles, and the tops of its feet are also white-colored. Urshifu's fighting style and personality are determined by how it trained as a Kubfu and which one of the special scrolls it reads from one of the Towers of Two Fists. Urshifu is the evolved form of the 'secret armor' of the Isle of Armor's Master Dojo, and reaches its full potential through either the path of darkness or the path of waters. It is also known to enjoy eating honey, particularly Max Honey found in Honeycalm Island.

Its body is primarily covered in coarse black fur, though its chest and belly are patterned with shorter gray fur. Its upper snout, palms, and rings around its eyes are devoid of fur, and its skin is a light gray. The fur around the side of its head angles into wing-like crests on either side of its eyes. The eyes themselves have red sclerae, green irises, and black, slitted pupils. Its teeth are pointed and its canines are visible when its mouth is closed.\nZarude can extend prehensile vines from its wrists, neck, and the soles of its feet at will. It uses these strong and flexible vines to attack, swing from trees, and collect food from a distance. Zarude's vines can also rapidly heal wounds when wrapped around them, and absorb energy from trees. While resting, only the tips of the vines at Zarude's neck and feet extend beyond its skin. However, the vines extending from Zarude's wrists are typically wrapped around its forearms in four concentric rings. Occasionally, Zarude's vines tear off and become nutrients for the soil of the forests it lives in. As shown in Secrets of the Jungle , the number of vines can vary, and may indicate a Zarude's age or importance, with Zarude possessing the most vines being the oldest or most dominant.\nZarude are social and live in troops. They're usually incredibly aggressive, and frighten most other Pok\u00e9mon. They attack anyone that aren't part of their pack; they excel in battle with their sharp claws and quick wit.

Two red spikes shaped like wings are located behind its back, although it doesn't use these to fly, as it is capable of floating in the air. Regidrago's body and the \"eye sockets\" on its right arm can glow pink when attacking.\nAccording to legend, Regidrago was created by Regigigas using crystallized dragon energy; however, Regigigas ran out of crystals after building Regidrago's head. Regidrago was then sealed away in a temple by ancient people, who feared the destruction it would cause should it ever be completed. Due to its body composition, Regidrago is said to have the most powerful Dragon-type moves of all Pok\u00e9mon, along with the power of every Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon.

Its mane consists of ice spikes, with three rows behind its neck and a single large spike between its ears. Both have ice behind them, connecting to the mask of ice that covers the left side of its face, which is noted to be 100 times harder than diamond. Its eyes are white with no visible pupils. Its thin tail is covered in ice that has four spikes jutting out from the sides. Its legs have ice covering its hooves and fetlocks , with the ice on its forelegs extending to the knees.\nGlastrier possesses incredible physical strength and extraordinary destructive power. It is noted to be an aggressive Pok\u00e9mon that forcefully takes anything it wants. Glastrier generates extremely cold air within its body and emits it from its nose and hooves. While Glastrier cannot move fast, it can freeze the ground to allow it to slide across the ice in a flash. Glastrier's legs allows it to travel through the snowiest of lands and worst of roads. It enjoys challenging any strong opponents it finds worthy of battling. [1]\nGlastrier was known to be very proud and arrogant, preferring to serve those it deems the strongest. It once ruled over the Crown Tundra like a lord, terrorizing its residents for intruding on its territory. This lasted until it was defeated and tamed by Calyrex using the Reins of Unity . Glastrier has a fondness for carrots , particularly Iceroot Carrots . It also loves Glastrier Treats made by Snacksworth , who once encountered it in the past.\nBy combining with Calyrex, Glastrier can channel a cold temperature up to \u2212508\u00a0\u00b0F (\u2212300\u00a0\u00b0C). The cold temperature allows Calyrex's psychic abilities to reach their full power, with a range of at least 30 miles. Glastrier's endurance also increases to the point it can run up to seven days and nights. This allows the powered up steed and Ice Rider Calyrex to smash and freeze anything in its path no matter the difficulty of the road. Glastrier's intense cold can be channeled into gigantic icicles, by combining Ice Rider Calyrex's psychic powers. The icicles is powerful enough to blow holes in rocky mountains, allowing the Glastrier to travel through it completely along with Ice Rider Calyrex.

            "description": "Spectrier is an equine Pok\u00e9mon with black fur and a purple marking covering the right side of its face extending to the base of its ears. Its left eye is closed with thick, mauve-colored eyelashes. It has a wavy purple mane that transitions into mauve towards the tips, with the tips themselves being translucent. Its fringe and tail are completely mauve. It has slender legs marked with a purple sock pattern. Each of its purple hooves is detached from its legs at the pastern , and the rear pair of the hooves are trailed by spectral mist.\nAs Spectrier desires isolation and silence, it tends to be active during the night where its energy is heightened. Its nocturnal habits resulted in it having weak eyesight, but its other four senses are keenly sharpened; this allows Spectrier to have an accurate sense of the terrain and location of living things. Its kicks are said to separate a soul from its body, and it can steal the life force of sleeping beings. It feeds on the ambient life-force it steals from others and will attack anyone who would try to disturb it. [1]\nSpectrier is known to be very proud and arrogant, preferring to serve individuals it deems the strongest. It once ruled over the Crown Tundra , lording over all the other Pok\u00e9mon living there and terrorizing humans who intrude on its territory. This lasted until it was defeated and tamed by Calyrex using the Reins of Unity . Spectrier has a fondness for carrots , particularly Shaderoot Carrots . It also loves Spectrier Treats made by Snacksworth , who once encountered it in the past.\nWhen fused with Calyrex, Spectrier's speed becomes swift to the point it can run a thousand miles within a single day. The strength of Spectrier's spectral power also increases. By Shadow Rider Calyrex's psychic influence, Spectrier can create countless small will-o'-the-wisps. These wisps have the power to steal the opponent's life-force with burning heat. Calyrex can also transform the steed's spectral aura into a black mass. This mass is powerful enough to absorb the life-force and souls of any being's energy like a black hole. [3]\nSpectrier is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Grim Neigh as its Ability .",

Four prongs grow from its head to support a green, transparent bud resembling a type of crown, much larger than its head. Inside the crown-shaped head is a white pistil at the center. A ring of green spheres, marked with an inlaid series of blue and white triangles, adorns its neck. The crown-like bud on Calyrex's head glows bright green when it uses its powers.\nCalyrex is said to have ruled Galar in ancient times as a merciful king. Despite its delicate and slight appearance, it can move with grace and dignity. It is known to be highly intelligent; Calyrex is one of the few Pok\u00e9mon able to fluently understand and speak the human language via telepathy, the latter only possible when it is at its full power however. It can also take control of a human's body in order to communicate when it is in a weakened state. It also has the power to see the past, present, and future of any kind when at full power. One legend said Calyrex used its foresight ability to save creatures of a forest from a meteor one time. One fairy tale even mentions Calyrex stealing the body of a human that causes mischief.\nIt is known as the \" King of Bountiful Harvests \" by Crown Tundra 's inhabitants due to its role in bringing lush vegetation and harvests yearly. Calyrex's right hand can cause the land to be covered in verdant grass and blooms, while its left hand allows it to make fields of fruit ripen and become heavy. Calyrex can grow either Iceroot or Shaderoot Carrots , depending on the field where Carrot Seeds are planted on, with a special dance. Calyrex can also create the Radiant Petal needed for the Reins of Unity and with enough energy, even a complete flower. It can provide healings or blessings such as mending the heart. While it shows no mercy to those that stand in its way, it will heal the wounds of a foe afterwards. Calyrex is powerful enough to move an entire forest and its Pok\u00e9mon to a new location. In PASS38 , it's revealed that Calyrex participated the first Darkest Day where it met Eternatus for the first time.",

Wyrdeer also has a brown nose and black cloven hooves, as well as two tufts of fur on the back of each lower leg.\nWyrdeer is well-beloved by the people in the Hisui region due to its highly prized fur, which provides excellent insulation from the cold and is used to make clothing. By using the orbs on its antlers, Wyrdeer can unleash psychic powers strong enough to distort space, and also create invisible barriers for protection. It also uses the antlers to lead Stantler herds and search for safe paths to travel. Wyrdeer's sturdy legs allow it to gallop and dash across the land, and jump over any obstacle in its way. Wyrdeer is implied to be extinct in the present day, Stantler are said to be no longer capable of evolving into Wyrdeer and they're not known to be found anywhere.\nWyrdeer and its pre-evolved form, Stantler, are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Psyshield Bash .\nA special Wyrdeer is also worshiped due to being descended from one of the ten ancient Pok\u00e9mon who received a blessing from Arceus and serves as a Ride Pok\u00e9mon .

The large wings present on Scyther's back seem to have atrophied into vestigial features on Kleavor. Most notably, each of Kleavor's two spindly front limbs end in large axe-like appendages made of heavy black rock, capable of causing severe damage to the hardiest of foes. Kleavor swings these appendages to carve and chop down trees, marking its territory. It also uses these heavy stone axes to finish off prey.\nKleavor is an Evolution of Scyther caused by Black Augurites , which are said to originate from volcanic regions in Hisui but are now extremely rare. The stones that adorn Kleavor's body often get chipped during fierce fights; larger chips are a sign that it is experienced in battle. Stone shards that fell off Kleavor during the battle were known to have been collected and used by the settlers of Hisui to craft tools. Kleavor is known to be very hostile, and it is best avoided if ever encountered in the wild. Kleavor's nature is described as being rough, crude, and violent.\nKleavor is implied to be at the brink of extinction in the present day, only known to be found in Blueberry Academy , located somewhere in Unova's ocean, specifically in its Terarium 's Canyon Biome .\nKleavor is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Stone Axe .\nA special Kleavor is worshiped by the Hisui people as he is descended from one of the ten ancient Pok\u00e9mon blessed by Arceus .

Its face has a light-yellow circle resembling a full moon on the forehead, two gray eyebrows resembling clouds, and a light yellow snout that contains a small, black nose and sharp canine teeth.\nUrsaluna's Evolution is believed to have been triggered by Ursaring being exposed to the swampy terrain of the Hisui region during a full moon. Ursaluna's physique allows it to travel through the swamps with ease, and it can also manipulate peat to its advantage. Ursaluna are known to be good at searching for items, and even missing persons, using their sense of smell.\nUrsaluna is implied to be at the brink of extinction in the present day, with only one specimen known to exist, found in Kitakami 's Timeless Woods .\nA special Ursaluna is worshipped in Hisui for being a descendant of the ten ancient Pok\u00e9mon blessed by Arceus . It is one of the Ride Pok\u00e9mon who resides in Crimson Mirelands , watched over by the warden Calaba . This special Ursaluna is known to assist humans.",

            "description": "Basculegion is a large, green, fish-like Pok\u00e9mon. It has a jagged mouth with pointed teeth. Its spine is aligned with a dark gray line, with colored stripes that flank it on either side and extend around its gills, along with spots scattered across its body. These accents are red in male Basculegion, and light blue in female Basculegion. Their eyes also match the appropriate color, and they look fierce on males and drowsy or sad on females. It has a pair of white pectoral fins, a three-spiked dorsal fin, and a two-spiked ventral fin. Additional smoke-like features cover Basculegion's face in a manner resembling barbels; female Basculegion sport shorter ones and lack the two small fins that the males have on their chin, instead having more blue markings around their lips and eyes. Basculegion's evolution is achieved by a White-Striped Basculin being possessed by the souls of other Basculin in its school who did not survive their harsh journey swimming upstream. These souls wrap around Basculegion's body, particularly along its rear half. They are colored red on male Basculegion, said to be caused by the souls' rage; and light blue on female Basculegion, whose paleness resulted from the sadness within the souls. When it senses danger, Basculegion will turn hostile and attack along with its souls until the enemy is defeated. The souls within Basculegion are said to have a will of their own and provide Basculegion with the power needed to swim on without tiring.Male Basculegion are known for their powerful jumps, while female Basculegion can conjure and control terrifying illusions against its opponents. Basculegion is said to have no equal in the rivers of the Hisui region. In the present day, it's only known to be found in Kitakami's Timeless Woods along with its pre-evolved form.",

Its fur is longer on its shoulders. It has long arms that extend to just above its ankles. On each arm is a dark spot, and its hands have three long claws tipped with poison, which are black with three red lines streaking through. Like its pre-evolved form, it has sharp, narrow eyes with red pupils and black markings resembling eyelashes on the edges. It has yellow diamond-shaped gems on its chest and head, and three sharp toes on each foot. Its left ear has a long black and red feather that extends down to its back; it also has red and black feathers for a tail.\nSneasler's evolution was the result of Hisuian Sneasel adapting to life on cliffsides in the frozen highlands of Hisui . Despite Sneasler's lanky build, it possesses great strength owing to its vicious claws. Due to its severe poison and deadly physical power, no other Pok\u00e9mon species could defeat Sneasler in its habitat. Using its claws, Sneasler is capable of climbing up walls and cliffs with ease. Unlike its counterpart, Weavile , it prefers to be alone instead of living in packs.\nSneasler is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Dire Claw .\nA special Sneasler is worshiped in Hisui due to her being descended from one of the 10 ancient Pok\u00e9mon who received a blessing from Arceus . In particular, she is one of the Ride Pok\u00e9mon who resides in the Coronet Highlands , watched over by the warden Ingo . This special Sneasler is known to assist humans.",

All over its body are overgrown conical spikes whose colors correspond to those on Overqwil's body. Its top half is black while its bottom half is light yellow; the two halves meet in the middle and form a wave pattern. The spikes on the top half of its body have parts of purple at their tips, and two very long spikes at the top and bottom of its body jut out in a straight direction. Above its eyes and around part of the top half of its body, Overqwil has circular purple dots. Its lips also have a purple coloration and appear puffy, and its small light-yellow eyes have purple pupils and are always fixated on an annoyed expression. In between its eyes are two pairs of spikes, the outer ones being longer and resembling eyebrows. Its large tail appears flat with a black outline and a purple inside, which also has a pattern that resembles the letter \"Q.\"\nOverqwil has a very aggressive personality along with a short temper, which has given it the nickname \"sea fiend.\" Its diet consists of poison. Overqwil's poisonous spikes will react automatically even while Overqwil sleeps. The barbed spikes will stab any moving thing that approaches Overqwil. Once the barbed spikes have punctured a target, they cannot be removed so easily. It has been recently seen along with its pre-evolution, offshore in cold parts of the world.\nOverqwil and its pre-evolved form, Hisuian Qwilfish , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Barb Barrage .",

Its eyes are yellow with beady white irises and no visible pupils. The front of Enamorus's body is covered in magenta spots, most of them shaped like diamonds, pebbles, and magatamas. Its thin chest consists of two joined diamond-shaped pectorals, its shoulders are adorned with magatama shapes, and on top of its navel is a teardrop, all colored magenta. It has two spotted thin arms, with five fingers on each hand. Its lower body consists of a trailing cloud, with a long, brown tail resembling a snake wrapped twice around its neck. Enamorus's tail has magenta heart markings lined in black running its span, with a pair in place at the end of its tail resembling eyes and another resembling a mouth. Enamorus is known as the Herald of Spring and God of Spring. The reason is that it arrived from the sea into the Hisui region. This usually signals the end of winter and the rise of the spring season. Enamorus tends to reside in the Crimson Mirelands. It stays in Incarnate Forme when staying in a region. Enamorus's love was said to have given rise to fresh life in the Hisui region. It can unleash mini hearty whirlwinds along with surrounding itself with a wind shield to protect itself from harm.",

When its mouth is open, two pointed teeth can be seen in its upper jaw. It has a fluffy tail and small paws with pink paw pads underneath and no visible toes.\nSprigatito is capricious and attention-seeking, and it tends to sulk if ignored by people. Sprigatito can rub its paws together to unleash a sweet, therapeutic aroma that mesmerizes anyone near it and causes its foes to stop battling. The scent becomes more potent when Sprigatito is exposed to sunlight. Sprigatito can absorb moisture into its fur by grooming it, which helps it to perform photosynthesis. It washes its face regularly to avoid drying out. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Sprigatito can spread this scent around by moving around as it sleeps.

Dark green colorations adorn the lower part of this neck fur, along with its hands, feet, and face; the latter is patterned to resemble a mask. Its face also has pink eyes and a small pink nose. Floragato's fur can change in hardness depending on its mood \u2014 its fur becomes sharp as needles when it is ready to battle. Each of its hands and feet has a round, pink paw pad and three digits, with visible claws on its fingers.\nThere is a vine tucked inside Floragato's fur, which has a hard, round, pink flower bud on the end. Floragato wields the vine and swings the bud to attack its opponents. In the anime, the vines can be used to pull others towards the user and even knock off objects held by other Pok\u00e9mon. The bud additionally serves as a toy. When not in use, the bud is kept on the left side of Floragato's chest, near its neck. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Floragato plays with the bud while sleeping.\nFloragato is intelligent and dexterous. It is also mischievous and likes showing off, desiring attention and companionship from others. If its Trainer refuses to give it attention, Floragato may misbehave by pulling pranks, such as tying the Trainer with its vine while they are asleep. [2]",

            "description": "Meowscarada is a humanoid feline Pok\u00e9mon with light green fur covering most of its body \u2014 stopping just above its long, dark green legs \u2014 and a short, fluffy tail. The fur is especially longer around its ears, thighs, and arms, the latter resembling poofy sleeves. Its face has lazy pink eyes and a small pink nose, and is covered in a four-pointed mask-like shape, with a pattern of three green diamonds on it. Its ears are curiously more droopy compared to its pre-evolutions, its mask instead giving the impression of perked-up cat ears. Each of Meowscarada's hands has three fingers tipped with green claws, as well as a pink paw pad. On its neck is a pink collar resembling flower petals. This collar holds together its cape, which grows from the leaves it had around its neck as Floragato . The cape is lined with reflective fur, is black on the outside and green on the inside, and splits into two near the base, with both parts of the cape ending in fleur-de-lis shapes.\nMeowscarda is said to be a talented magician. Meowscarada carries a four-petaled green flower, whose stem is hidden by the reflective fur on its cape, creating the illusion of floating. The flower can blossom into a round, pollen-filled flower bomb, with a two-tone green and black zigzag pattern on the outside, and six petals adorning the top. In a battle, Meowscarada uses skillful misdirection to stealthily plant these flower bombs onto various surfaces around its unaware foes before setting them off, catching their opponents off guard. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Meowscarda occasionally attempts to perform magic while it sleeps. However, this performance tends to not go as planned.\nMeowscarada has a proud, showy personality; however, it is also sensitive and prone to jealousy. It can often be very attached to its Trainer, and it will become upset if its Trainer gives attention to other Pok\u00e9mon. [1]\nMeowscarada is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Flower Trick .",

Its body contains a small flame sac, which constantly leaks fire energy due to its size. The energy releases in the form of two bright yellow tufts of flame on top of its head; should Fuecoco get excited, more of these tufts of flame may emerge. As shown in the anime , Fuecoco's tufts can emit light. Fuecoco has black eyes and triangular nostrils, and its mouth has three teeth, with one in the upper jaw and two in the lower jaw. It has stubby arms and large feet with two black toes on each foot. Fuecoco has yellow square scales on its stomach, back, tail, and the soles of its feet. These scales are warm to the touch, although they can become heated. The scales absorb external heat, such as from warm rocks where it lies on, to be turned into fire energy. [1]\nFuecoco is laid-back and does things at its own pace. It enjoys eating, and it will rush towards any food it sees. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Fuecoco and its evolutions are known to sometimes sleep with one eye open. While asleep, Fuecoco sometimes moves its mouth as if it is chewing.",

Its stout, melon-shaped body is primarily red, but its face and chest are white simulating a mask; its hands and feet are black with three digits each. It has yellow rectangular scales covering its back and tail, and a pattern of black and yellow stripes on its chest. Its face has a long snout, red square cheeks, a pattern of two red triangles resembling nostrils, and a hook-like upper jaw. When Crocalor opens its mouth, three pairs of sharp teeth can be seen lining its lower jaw.\nAtop Crocalor's head is an orange mass of fire energy shaped like a nest, with yellow squares patterning it. This \"nest\" contains a yellow, glowing, egg-shaped fireball on top, borne out of Crocalor's fire energy and overflowing vitality. Crocalor can control the fireball, sending it out and using it for its moves. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Crocalor and its evolutionary relatives are known to sometimes sleep with one eye open. The fireball on Crocalor's head never falls off even as the Pok\u00e9mon sways rhythmically in its sleep.\nCrocalor's internal flame sac has a valve that connects to its vocal cords. As a result, Crocalor lets out guttural cries as it releases fire from its mouth. Its voice can hardly be described as beautiful; moreover, its voice becomes more destructive as it breathes more powerful fire. [1]",

            "description": "Skeledirge is a large, red, crocodilian Pok\u00e9mon covered in rectangular scales. Its belly is angular and has a white coloration flanked by black stripes on either side, resembling an open suit jacket and dress shirt. It also has various white-colored patterns on its head, lower jaw, neck, back, shoulders, arms, legs, and the cylindrical tip of its tail. The white coloration on the top of its head resembles a lute . Skeledirge has three black claws on each foot, and although it usually walks on all fours, it is capable of standing on its hind legs.\nSkeledirge's head is delineated with a black circular shape at the top. It has black eyes with yellow irises and red eyelids, serrated jaws with purple insides, and various square and triangular patterns that come in red, orange, yellow, and purple. A wreath of solid orange-and-yellow fire energy emerges from the back of Skeledirge's jaws, which circles around its head.\nThere is an orange fiery bird resting on top of Skeledirge's head, which is a separate, independent entity from the Pok\u00e9mon. This bird is spherical, with a yellow face, white eyes, a short crest and tail, and a singular tiny pointed \"foot\" it balances itself on. It is said that the bird was born when the egg-shaped fireball Skeledirge had as a Crocalor gained a soul, which also gave Skeledirge its Ghost typing . The bird can sometimes be seen pecking at Skeledirge's jaws, supposedly cleaning its teeth.\nAs shown in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Skeledirge and its pre-evolutions are known to sometimes sleep with one eye open. Even when Skeledirge's sleep is shallow, it doesn't mind the fiery bird on its head moving about and playing pranks on it.\nSkeledirge has a meddlesome but caring personality. Its singing is gentle, but powerful and full of vitality, capable of soothing the souls of all who hears it. Opponents hearing its singing will feel warm and fulfilled inside, losing their will to battle. Skeledirge burns its enemies by unleashing flames that exceed the temperature of 5,400\u00a0\u00b0F (3,000\u00a0\u00b0C). When Skeledirge sings, its fire bird transforms into a microphone for Skeledirge, growing its \"foot\" longer until it reaches the ground. The bird is then powered up by the Skeledirge's singing, growing larger, and flying towards its enemy .\nSkeledirge is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning Torch Song .",

Quaxly's coif has a smooth feel thanks to the rich, moist cream that holds it. The cream it secretes can repel grime. The coif can become unkempt should it get dry. [1]\nQuaxly is an earnest and tidy Pok\u00e9mon, and tends to overthink things. Quaxly's feathers secrete a glossy gel which protects its body against water and grime. It hates getting itself dirty, especially on its head. Quaxly's strong legs allow it to swim without issues, even in strong currents. It also uses its legs to repeatedly kick its foes with swift speed. Although found in Paldea , Quaxly is not native to the region, instead having migrated from faraway places a long time ago. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , the coif on its head grows dry and messy should Quaxly sleep for a very long time. However, this tend to happen on extremely rare occasions.",

On top of Quaxwell's head is a round blue crest twice as large, which droops towards the back. Various blue and teal-colored feathers also adorn its chest, forearms, tail, and the insides of its feet. The three feathers at the end of its arms are similar to fingers. Quaxwell's legs are long and its feet are yellow with three toes each, and they wrap around its ankles in a manner that resembles ballet shoes.\nThe crest above Quaxwell's head is capable of absorbing impacts, and is used by Quaxwell to shield itself from incoming attacks. Doing this may mess up the crest, however, which causes its body and mind to feel unwell and weakened. If its crest becomes unkempt and messy, it will quickly use gel to comb it back into shape. [1]\nQuaxwell has a serious, stoic personality, though it is also known to be temperamental. It learns and practices dance routines by observing the movements of people and Pok\u00e9mon from various regions. Quaxwell is a hard worker, and constantly trains its strength and technique. Flocks of Quaxwell train by running their legs through shallow waters, and then compete with each other for the most graceful kicks. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex , Quaxwell maintains its beautiful posture. However, the daily training it maintains can occasionally leave it too tired to care for its coif. As a result, the coif is usually left messy as it sleeps.",

            "description": "Quaquaval is a humanoid avian Pok\u00e9mon resembling a waterfowl. Its plumage is mostly dark blue, except for the light blue on its shoulders and tail, along with the white on its head, neck, chest, and individual tail feathers. Its face has blue eyes and a pointed yellow beak. Atop its head is a large, flowing, slick, dark blue crest, with long light blue and orange-red feathers at the front, separating the crest from the head. Its forearms have three sets of feathers, each tipped with light blue; and it has what resembles hands with three \"fingers\" each. Additional light blue accents decorate its waist and legs. Its yellow feet have bulbous segments with three toes each; the front-most segments are orange in color. It has a defined rump and an elaborate-looking tail, with a circular base and three teardrop-shaped feathers decorating it at the top, along with two chains consisting of three feathers flanking it on either side.\nIn battle, Quaquaval is accompanied with a series of teardrop-shaped decorative water feathers, which are ejected from the organs on its tail feathers and fanned out behind its back. When attacking, these water feathers move forward and spin around Quaquaval's body, making a buzzsaw-like arrangement that it uses to slice into its enemies. Quaquaval's legs are well-trained and have incredible strength, being able to launch a truck away with a single kick. It uses its legs to perform dance moves, some of which appear to be based on dances from faraway lands. Quaquaval is viewed by Tsareena as its rival. Quaquaval's dances can mesmerize all those who see it. Even while Quaquaval is asleep, it has been seen swaying its whole body at every opportunity. On occasion, a sleeping Quaquaval has been seen striking elegant poses.\nQuaquaval has a cheerful and energetic disposition, dancing away no matter what situation it faces. However, it is also stoic and very serious, especially when it comes to consistently polishing its skills. It can become very focused during critical situations. [1]\nQuaquaval is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Aqua Step .",

Its ears are droopy with yellow insides, and they partially cover its eyes. It has a triangular pink snout with two huge oval nostrils as well as stubby feet ending in pink hooves. Its tail is short and curled.\nLechonk has an excellent sense of smell, which it uses to find fragrant wild grasses and rich Berries to eat. This diet causes it to emanate a herbal body odor that repels bug Pok\u00e9mon. Lechonk is also known to feed on the sweet nectar on Appletun 's back. Lechonk has a timid and faint-hearted temperament, and will panic and charge forward if attacked or startled by an opponent. Despite its apparent bulk, Lechonk's body mainly consists not of fat but of muscle, built up by its habit of walking around to find food. Some Trainers use Lechonk to look for cooking ingredients, such as detached Crabominable pincers scattered on mountains. As seen in the anime , Lechonk will become hostile towards trainers carrying groceries or meals and attack them for their food.",

            "description": "Spidops is an arachnoid Pok\u00e9mon resembling a net-casting spider. It has eight long, slender, cylindrical legs, bunched together into pairs to evoke a humanoid stance. All eight feet possess white circular ports that serve as spinnerets, which Spidops can use to string silk tripwires and nets. Spidops can alternate at will between separating its legs or clustering them together for a quadrupedal crawl. These pairs of legs converge upon spherical joints nestled within the sides of its body, two positioned like shoulders near its head and two beside the ring-shaped intersection dividing its chest and abdomen.\nSpidops's body is mostly beige brown, with pine green colorations on its face, forelimbs, and chest \u2014 the latter patterned to resemble a vest or overalls. Its ovular head is adorned with two large black eyes with squinted white pupils, along with four eye-like protrusions on either side. It also has rhombus-shaped pedipalps protruding from its sides to evoke a mustache, and two chelicerae bunched together to form a shield shape, which hides a circular mouth. Spidops's abdomen is cylindrical and cloaked in bands of its white silk to resemble a spool of yarn, ending at the tip with a flat conical peg containing its ninth spinneret.\nSpidops is a covert ambush predator that utilizes its sticky and resilient silk threads to cling upon any surface and move without making a sound. It spins a silk thread from the spinneret on its abdomen, which it uses to hang upside-down from tall places. It then spins a net between its top four legs which it uses to smother its prey, striking before the prey has time to react. It prefers sticking onto the sides of trees, and strings its territory with silken hazards to trap intruders. It actively spars against its rival, Scyther , to maintain its ground and ensure the safety of its Tarountula young.\nSpidops is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Silk Trap .",

Its thorax and abdomen are separated by a white belt, with an X-shaped pattern at the front. It has a pair of white claws on each of its hands, and a single claw on each foot. Its forearms have an orange spike each, while its calves have two orange spikes protruding towards the back.\nBehind Lokix's body is its third set of legs, attached to its abdomen. These legs are oblong with a symbol resembling the general prohibition sign on the outside of the joints, and connect to thin, rectangular forelimbs. Each of the forelimbs have five orange spikes and a single white claw at the bottom. Lokix usually keeps its third set of legs folded on its back; however, it can unfold these legs to enter what is known as its Showdown Mode.\nIn Showdown Mode, Lokix stands and jumps on its now-unfolded third set of legs, and swings them to attack. Lokix utilizes its Showdown Mode to fight all-out, being capable of quickly subduing its foes in this mode. However, it cannot be in Showdown Mode for too long, as it places a huge strain on its body. Lokix can live in a variety of different areas in Paldea, such as grasslands, snowy mountains, deserts, and lakes.",

If it feels threatened, it will rub its cheeks to generate electricity, which it then delivers to its opponents by touching them with its forepaws. The organs on its forepaws turn teal-blue when discharging. Pawmi's thick fur provides insulation against the cold and allows it to store electricity. [3]",

Pawmo has five fingers on its forelimbs which are considerably large, and stretches down to its tiny feet. Pawmo's forepaws contain yellow pads that turn teal-blue when releasing electricity. It uses these paw pads for its signature fighting technique, where it simultaneously strikes and zaps foes with its forepaws. Pawmo are known to travel in groups. When attacked, Pawmo will be the first to fight back, defeating foes with its electricity.",

Each individual is small, white, and bipedal, and has a spherical head with large ears and stubby limbs with large paws. Each one also has two black beady eyes, a tiny black nose with short whiskers, and a long tail which curls up and ends with a bulbous tip. One of the pair has a light-gray patch of fur surrounding its chest which resembles a shirt, while the other has a light-gray patch of fur surrounding its legs, which resembles a pair of pants. When they open their mouths, which take up over half of their faces when fully open, a single upper incisor can be seen on the insides of each one.\nThe pair that forms Tandemaus sticks together no matter what. They exhibit great teamwork: they share any food they find equally within the pair, and they build their nest together using materials they've gathered with their incisors. Tandemaus's evolution into Maushold is considered somewhat of a mystery, as the little individuals that form the group seem to appear out of nowhere.\nTandemaus and its evolved form, Maushold , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Population Bomb .",

            "description": "Maushold is a group of three or four separate mouse-like rodent Pok\u00e9mon which work together as one, similar to Exeggcute , Falinks , or its pre-evolved form Tandemaus . Each individual is small, white, and bipedal, and has a spherical head with large ears and stubby limbs that have large paws. Each one also has two black beady eyes, a tiny black nose with short whiskers, and a long tail which curls up and ends with a bulbous tip. When they open their mouths, which take up over half of their faces when fully open, a single upper incisor can be seen on the insides of each one.\nTwo of the individuals are larger, and their appearance is virtually unchanged from Tandemaus, where one has a light-gray patch of fur surrounding its chest which resembles a shirt, while the other has a light-gray patch of fur surrounding its legs, which resembles a pair of pants. The pair are accompanied by one or two smaller ones, which lack the light-gray patch of fur and have shorter tails and stubbier limbs. The smaller ones tend to hide behind the larger pair, and hold onto the tips of their tails when walking.\nNo one knows where the smaller individuals that form Maushold come from. The larger and smaller individuals live together and act as a family; however, their actual relationship is unclear. The larger individuals protect the smaller ones in battle, although they will all work together when faced with strong opponents. Maushold create and live in huge nests comprising many rooms with different purposes, such as eating and sleeping.\nMaushold and its pre-evolved form, Tandemaus , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Population Bomb .",

It has tan legs with feet shaped in a zygodactyl arrangement; i.e. two toes each on the front and back. Each toe is tipped with a yellow claw. Squawkabilly has a rounded, lumpy black crest on its head that resembles a pompadour , and white feathers on its eyelids, face, belly, and the tips of its wings. The rest of its feathers have different colorations depending on the form, which come in green, blue, yellow, and off-white. The feathers around the bottom of its body are notably longer, giving the appearance of a longcoat.\nSquawkabilly are known to be exceptionally noisy. They have a strong sense of community and dislike being alone, so they cooperate and form flocks that can contain more than fifty individuals based on the color of their feathers. In the mornings and evenings, they search for food in forests, towns, and cities; the latter is their preferred habitat, where they fight with other Squawkabilly of different plumes over territory. Green Plumage Squawkabilly make up the largest, most powerful groups, and are viewed by their Blue Plumage counterparts as rivals. Yellow Plumage Squawkabilly are especially fierce, engaging in vicious close combat and driving other bird Pok\u00e9mon out of towns. White Plumage Squawkabilly have the fewest population numbers, although they are still able to hold territory because their feathers help them camouflage against the white buildings of cities. Squawkabilly once had violent territorial disputes with Fletchling , who inhabit the same rural and urban areas.\nIn Paldea , Squawkabilly is used for the region's Flying Taxi service. Certain Squawkabilly, such as the one found in Medali in the core series games, and Diana 's in the anime , are shown to be capable of mimicking human speech .",

Bits of salt are scraped off of Nacli as it travels the ground, although Nacli is able to create and replenish the salt inside its body. The rear corners of Nacli's lower body are rounded as a result of this scraping . As revealed in HZ057 , Nacli lived in Paldean lands since ancient times, forming bonds with humans. In the same episode, it is also thought that Nacli used to help humans in warding off evil spirits for hundreds of years. In the past, it was treasured by people who would use its salt; even today, Nacli salt is still used in foods such as ice cream, because it has a gentle flavor.\nNacli and its evolutions are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Purifying Salt as an Ability .",

            "description": "Naclstack is a quadrupedal Pok\u00e9mon whose body is made of rock salt. Its cubic head is white with a few cracks and two eyes in the shape of right angles. Each of the eyes are orange in color with yellow squares at their centers, and they can glow an orange-red. The head is connected to Naclstack's body; the upper half of the body consists of a brown cuboid stone at the front and a rugged, dark brown rock dotted with salt at the back, while the lower body is a single white cuboid. Naclstack's body doesn't connect to its legs and floats in place relative to them. The legs themselves are cube-shaped, with light brown on top and white at the bottom. Each of the cubes have a small brown stone on one of their corners, which seem to act as claws for the Pok\u00e9mon.\nNaclstack attacks by pressing the rock salt inside its body into hardened pellets, which it then shoots out with enough force to puncture an iron sheet. Naclstack also uses its salt to dry out and cure its prey. Naclstack leaves behind bits of salt on its footprints as it walks; these salt grains are gathered by people and used as seasoning for sandwiches .\nNaclstack and its evolved form, Garganacl , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Salt Cure . Naclstack and its evolutionary relatives are also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Purifying Salt as an Ability .",

Garganacl's shoulders comprise tall three-stepped structures made up of blocks of white rock salt, below which its arms connect to. These stepped structures completely cover Garganacl's head from the sides. A taller block of salt is also present behind Garganacl's head.\nGarganacl's arms and legs are rugged and blocky, and they are similar in appearance and length, with the arms reaching close to the ground due to their location on the body. The upper limbs are dark brown at the base, while the forelimbs are decorated in stripes of lighter brown, before ending in white. Garganacl's hands have three fingers each. Garganacl's torso is really short in comparison to its limbs; it is brown and about as large as its head, with a white block of rock salt on the pelvic area that its legs connect to. Square patches of salt dot the entirety of Garganacl's body. Garganacl's salt is rich in minerals and known to have medicinal properties. Garganacl will scrape its fingertips together to share its salt with injured Pok\u00e9mon, which can heal them quickly. Many Pok\u00e9mon gather around Garganacl in hopes to lick up its salt.\nGarganacl and its pre-evolved form, Naclstack , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Salt Cure .

Its body is mostly black, except for its torso and extremities, which are red; and its head, which, apart from the face, is orange with red colorations on the top and back. The head is large and has a fire-like plume above it, tipped with pink and dark blue colors. Charcadet's forehead is covered with a black plate-like mask with three holes at the center, and its eyes have wisps emanating from its red-and-yellow pupils. Charcadet's head is connected to its body by a very tiny neck. Its torso resembles a tunic , with an orange protrusion at the front that seems to connect to its neck. Its hands and feet are cylindrical, and it has a fiery \"cape\" on its back. It has small, teardrop-shaped indents on its soles.\nCharcadet has a fiery fighting spirit, and will battle opponents tougher than itself. Its firepower increases as it fights, reaching temperatures of over 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 degrees Celsius). It enjoys eating Berries that are rich in fat. As revealed in HZ057 , Charcadet lived in Paldean lands since ancient times, forming bonds with humans. In the same episode, it is also said to have accompanied nobility and knights in the past. Charcadet's evolution is influenced by old sets of armor: one with auspicious wishes living within it and one with malicious will lurking within it .",

Its head is also red, with yellow sharp \"ears\" protruding from either side. The top of its head is yellow and has a fire burning on top, resembling the plume on a knight's helmet. Its face is covered with a black mask with three holes at the center, and its eyes have red irises and wisps emanating from its yellow pupils. Armarouge's torso and shoulders are covered in a yellow suit of armor and levitating large yellow pauldrons , respectively. The suit of armor has red accents on it.\nArmarouge's armor is said to have belonged to a distinguished warrior, and is the source of its psychic power. The armor allows Armarouge to control its inner fire energy and use attacks. Armarouge is loyal and believes in fighting fair, willing to fight head-on no matter how strong the foe is. It first focuses on using its sturdy armor for defense before using high firepower in order to take down opponents. When attacking, Armarouge moves its pauldrons to its hands and puts them together to form a cannon, which it uses to shoot projectiles.

From each side of its head, a sharp pale blue protrusion extends outward, giving the impression of ears; from the back of its head, a blue and purple fire burns upward, resembling the plume on a knight's helmet. Its eyes have pink irises and wisps emanating from its white pupils. A plate with three pink indentations on its center covers its face. Almost all of Ceruledge's body is covered in an old set of dark purplish-blue armor steeped with grudges . Instead of hands, Ceruledge wields purple-cyan blades created from both fire and ghost energy\u2014specifically, the lingering regrets of the fallen. These blades can grow into great swords in battle, increasing Ceruledge's power in the process . As seen in the Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series episode HZ065 , the blades can emit heat even when retracted.\nCeruledge is merciless and will do anything to win a battle. It prefers to do close-quarters combat, with a mix of sneak and surprise attacks. By using its quick speed to locate a foe's blind spots, it will then move closer before slashing them with its large swords. Any cuts from Ceruledge's swords will cause wounds that leak life energy, which the swords then absorb. [1]\nCeruledge is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Bitter Blade .",

Its elastic and squishy body is primarily green in color, with orange patterns on its head, back, and lower body, along with small orange feet. The pattern on its head is shaped like a rounded cross, while the patterns on its lower body are chevron-shaped. The pattern on its back consists of two orange chevrons and a lightning bolt shape, surrounding an orange circle with a yellow dot at the center.\nBellibolt has two white bumps on the sides of its head, each containing a black dot with a yellow border. These bumps resemble eyeballs, although they do not function as such. On the center of Bellibolt's face are its actual eyes, which are small, yellow, and resemble nostrils; along with its mouth, which has orange lips and small yellow cheek patches. Bellibolt's gray belly is covered with a semi-transparent membrane and has a yellow organ inside that resembles a navel, referred to as its belly-button dynamo. As Bellibolt's muscles - especially its well-developed abdominal muscles - expand and contract, this organ generates electricity, which Bellibolt discharges through the bumps on its head. These head bumps glow when discharging electricity, and they also allow Bellibolt to appear more intimidating. [2]\nBellibolt is capable of moving very quickly, but usually chooses to act sluggishly. It is difficult to train Bellibolt to initiate a battle because it has an easygoing temperament, and does not notice its opponents until it is attacked. At night, Bellibolt's stomach emits a strange noise, which signals that it is hungry. Bellibolt is seldom found in the wild, but may rarely be seen alongside riverbanks.\nBellibolt is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Electromorphosis as an Ability .",

Its head is nub-like and contains its fairly long orange beak, located just above the bottom of the crescent marking. Its eyes cover the tips of the crescent, which have white sclerae, black irises, and teal pupils. It has small webbed feet that are orange in color, and its tail splits into two.\nWattrel flies in a specific way so that its wings are able to catch the wind. Its bones, in reaction to the wind, create electricity for Wattrel, and it uses this ability to dive into bodies of water to electrocute its prey, such as Arrokuda . Their nests are located near the edge of coastal cliffs. The nests themselves have a crackling texture to them, and are known to be a popular delicacy throughout the Paldea region .\nWattrel and its evolved form, Kilowattrel , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Wind Power as an Ability.",

Shroodle's head contains large, yellow-green eyes with tiny black pupils; small semicircular ears on the sides; a single tuft of blonde hair on top; and a long, bulbous snout at the front. The snout contains a pair of sharp upper incisors, coated in a purple poison that can cause paralysis.\nShroodle has a mellow personality, but if angered, it will bite into the offender, inflicting them with its venom. It paints markings around its territory using a poisonous liquid with a sharp, unpleasant smell, in order to ward off intruders.",

The top half of its body is mostly black and somewhat resembles a hoodie, while its forearms and the bottom half of its body are dark bluish-gray in color, with white stripes on its thighs and bushy tail, and two white toes on its feet. It has a white face with large ears, huge yellow-green eyes, purple eyelids, and a short snout with four nostrils and sharp incisors. It also has four tufts of blonde hair above its forehead. Grafaiai's most notable physical feature is its hands: they have three fingers each, with the middle finger being several times longer than the other two. These fingers are coated with Grafaiai's poisonous saliva, with the finger on its right hand always seen with two drops of the saliva hanging from it.\nGrafaiai has a moody temperament and is attentive to detail. It is a solitary species, and often gets into territorial fights with other Pok\u00e9mon, including other Grafaiai. Grafaiai's saliva is brightly colored and poisonous, and its color changes depending on Grafaiai's diet, which includes Berries and Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon. Grafaiai uses this poisonous saliva to attack foes, either by spitting the saliva at them or by coating its hands with the saliva before slashing at them. Should Grafaiai sense danger, its poison becomes more concentrated and can immobilize a victim for about three days once absorbed. [2]\nGrafaiai is nocturnal. During the night, it licks its hands and fingers with its poisonous saliva, before using them to draw patterns on trees. This not only marks Grafaiai's territory, but it also draws in Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon with its sweet scent. The poison causes Grafaiai's prey to be immobilized and trapped until Grafaiai goes to collect them at dawn. Each Grafaiai has its own signature pattern, which it will paint over and over throughout its life.\nGrafaiai is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Doodle .",

Its stony, armored carapace has a rugged texture, with three roughly pentagonal shapes protruding from the top. Its eyes are supported by stalks extending from inside its shell; Klawf can freely rotate these eyes to survey its surroundings, leaving no blind spots. Klawf's mouth is large and has rectangular \"teeth\" resembling battlements . Klawf has eight appendages, with claws on its two front-most limbs. Black fur-like bristles protrude from between its eyes and cover its joints.\nKlawf hangs upside-down from the sheer cliffs on which it lives in order to ambush its prey from above; however, it can't stay in this position for too long as its blood will rush to its head, causing it to get dizzy. Klawf's claws are strong and dexterous and have a strong grip, especially on its prey. In battle, it sidesteps to dodge its opponents' attacks then goes for their weak spots with its claws. Klawf uses one of its claws to hold its opponent tight while using the other to break through its defenses. Klawf can grow back its claws if it loses them. In some parts of the Paldea region , Klawf's claws are used for cooking .

The red head on the right has an angry expression, while the light green head on the left appears more mischievous. Both heads have black eyes, stick their tongues out, and possess sharp fangs, the bottom pairs of which protrude below their lower jaws.\nScovillain is described as a ferocious Pok\u00e9mon whose rampage is unstoppable. The spicy chemicals in its brain stimulate both heads, turning the green head vicious while providing a source for the red head to convert into spicy, fiery energy, which it blasts its surroundings with.

Instead of a beak, it has a pointed, elongated snout, which hides a tiny mouth located at the bottom. Espathra's head, neck, and legs are lavender in color, with brown stripes covering its neck and white stripes covering its legs and front toes. Espathra has two front toes and a single back toe on each foot.\nEspathra's torso is large and covered in white feathers, and it has rounded brown wings on top. These wings have triangular patterns and short frills near their tips. Espathra has frills covering other parts of its body: white frills form a headdress shape over its head, and long yellow and white frills drape from its backside, forming its tail.\nEspathra is able to emit psychic powers from its eyes and the gaps between its frills. By using the psychic powers emitted from its eyes, it can immobilize foes. It is believed to be a highly aggressive Pok\u00e9mon species. Espathra's legs are long and powerful, allowing it to run at speeds of over 120 mph (200 km/h). Espathra makes its habitat in mountainous regions.\nEspathra is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Lumina Crash . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Opportunist as an Ability .",

On top of its head is a light pink cap with a white protrusion on top, resembling tied hair.\nTinkatink carries a crude, gray, cylindrical hammer with a short handle, which resembles a baby's rattle. It creates its own hammer using iron scraps, remaking it as many times as it wants until it is satisfied. Tinkatink uses the hammer to protect itself. However, the hammer is often stolen and eaten by Pok\u00e9mon with a metal diet. Tinkatink is a female-only species. Tinkatink resides in various ruins across Paldea .",

Its arms have five fingers each, with the thumbs having the same color of pink as the body. It has steel plates on its hips that resemble outturned pockets. Its face has silver eyes with thin eyelashes, and a large mouth with two square teeth-like growths on the upper lips. On top of its head is a large, pinkish-white growth resembling a twin-tail hairstyle, which droops over Tinkaton's back and has darker pink zigzag patterns accenting it.\nTinkaton wields a crude, gigantic metal hammer that weighs over 220 pounds (100\u00a0kg) and is larger than its own body. The hammer appears to have been made using the old hammer Tinkaton had as a Tinkatuff for the base, with several scraps of metal colored in varying shades of gray and purple welded onto it. The hammer also has a spiked beige axe-like structure on top. Although the hammer is heavy, Tinkaton can swing it with ease by using its whole body.\nTinkaton is intelligent and has a reckless personality. It swings its hammer at rocks to send them into the sky, aiming to hit flying Corviknight . This Pok\u00e9mon will also steal anything that it wants and take it back to its dwelling. It has been observed using its hammer like a bed to sleep on.\nTinkaton is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Gigaton Hammer .",

Although Wiglett has a stated Pok\u00e9dex height, it is unknown how long it really is underneath the sand, or what the rest of its body looks like. [1]\nWiglett lives in beaches and seas, where it burrows into beach sand. It pokes part of its body out of the ground to feed. Wiglett has an exceptional sense of smell, which has a range of over 60 feet (20 meters). Wiglett is a timid and cautious Pok\u00e9mon; it hides in the sand when it picks up the scents of other Pok\u00e9mon, such as Veluza , nearby. [1]\nSome researchers initially mistook Wiglett for the Paldean form of Diglett due to their physical resemblance, but they are separate species and differ in habitat and diet. It is theorized that the two species ended up having similar body plans as an adaptation to suit their environments and burrowing behavior. [2]",

On the sides of its body are pale bluish white wave patterns. It has a pair of pectoral fins and a split tailfin. Finizen has a ring of water surrounding the base of its tail, which it creates by mixing seawater with a fluid that it secretes from the singular blowhole atop its head. The water ring can detach from its body and grow in size, and Finizen uses it to play with others of its own kind.\nFinizen is able to sense the emotions of other creatures by using ultrasonic waves. It lives in pods, competes with Barraskewda for food, and is preyed upon by Dragalge .",

The front of Revavroom's body also has a few spikes to the left and right, along with a small hole resembling a frown located just below its eye, although this hole does not function as its mouth. On Revavroom's sides are eight cylinders, each one tipped with a purple stain. The two longest cylinders reach out towards the back and flare out at the ends; these cylinders function as the Pok\u00e9mon's exhaust. The remaining six cylinders sit on top of the two long cylinders, with three on each one.\nRevavroom's large, cylindrical mouth is located on top of its body and resembles air filters found on muscle car engines. This mouth has jagged serrations resembling teeth and contains a long tongue, which Revavroom uses to unleash toxic fluids. The top and bottom halves of the mouth do not connect with each other.\nRevavroom typically attaches itself to rocks that resemble the wheels and the body of a wagon, which it uses as a means of locomotion. It can create gas by combining the minerals in the rocks with its poison. The gas is then detonated in its cylinders to generate energy for itself. This aggressive Pok\u00e9mon uses the sounds of its exhaust to threaten foes. Revavroom typically levitates and flies around in the air instead of moving on the ground. Revavroom are capable of running machines when attached to them; this is evidenced by the Starmobiles , which are vehicles Ortega created for Revavroom to run as an engine alongside Varoom .

Its head is mostly black, with a green coloration between its casque and lower jaw, along with orange circular cheeks. Its neck, paw pads, and tail are also black; the latter has a white tip. Its rear has a covering resembling a motorcycle seat, located at the base of its tail. On its throat is a black sac with a white inner coloring, resembling a rubber tire.\nCyclizar has a mild temperament. It has been kept by humans and used for transport since ancient times, with depictions of this behavior found in murals dating back 10,000 years ago. This relationship appears to be mutualistic since the warmth of Cyclizar's rider helps it avoid getting cold, along with lifting its spirit. When carrying a human, Cyclizar can reach a speed of over 70\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h). Cyclizar maintains its balance and absorbs shock while running by using its hard head and thick yet supple tail. It also uses its head and tail to attack during battles. Cyclizar is strong enough to carry luggage and equipment used by humans. It has been seen equipped with metal seats and headlights, allowing humans to ride it more easily and navigate. In other cases, it has been seen equipped with a jet seat, allowing it to move faster as seen with Team Star .\nBoth Koraidon and Miraidon share a resemblance to Cyclizar, a detail noted in their own Pok\u00e9dex entries and by several people in Paldea ; it is later confirmed in the aforementioned games that they are ancient and futuristic relatives of Cyclizar, respectively. According to Jacq , Cyclizar has three forms . First, Cyclizar's basic form is where it walks on all four legs. Second, the battle form is where it stands on its hind legs in order to battle. Finally, the ride form, which it assumes when humans ride on it. When Cyclizar is being ridden on, it puffs up its throat sac and curls its tail, making the appearance of wheels.",

There are pairs of cyan ovals lining either side of its body from its third to fifth segments, while its second segment has three of such pairs. Tendrils can extend from the ovals on its second segment, which resemble simple fists.\nWhen threatened, Orthworm uses its blue tendrils like fists to pelt its opponent with a storm of punches. It lives in dry deserts, and eats iron from the soil to maintain its body. It is sometimes seen buried in the ground, with only its head visible.\nOrthworm is the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Earth Eater as an Ability .\nA giant Orthworm, known as the Lurking Steel Titan, is one of the Titan Pok\u00e9mon found in Paldea .

Rather than having actual teeth, Greavard instead has serrated lips. It has stubby limbs and large round feet, and it has a slight waddle to its walk. Its rear has a thin wispy tail. On the top of its head is a protrusion resembling a candle, which burns with a small purplish-yellow light.\nGreavard usually rests underground, with the candle-like part of its head left uncovered, as it waits for people to come nearby. If it is approached, it jumps out of the ground and lets a spooky cry that may unintentionally startle most people. Greavard is friendly, affectionate and easily gets lonely. It is really easy to befriend, and will forever follow anyone who gives it the slightest of attention. However, it is advised not to play with Greavard too often, as it is known to slowly and unwittingly drain the life-force of those near it. It is rumored that Greavard is the reincarnation of a dog Pok\u00e9mon that had never interacted with a human and died in the wild. Greavard primarily lives in boreal mountains.",

Veluza's fins extend underneath its flesh, to the center of its body; inside is also a row of diamond-shaped spikes similar to a backbone on either side, with three of these spikes being longer and protruding out from Veluza's flesh.\nVeluza's main method of hunting comes from its ability to shed its own flesh, via its signature move Fillet Away . This boosts its offensive prowess and psychic power, as well as its agility, giving it an easier time when chasing down and tearing apart prey. It can grow back its lost flesh due to its excellent regenerative capabilities. The discarded flesh has a mild yet delicious flavor.",

It has three gills on either side of its body.

Although powerful, Dondozo is dull and not very good at hunting, so it teams up with Tatsugiri to catch prey. The Tatsugiri baits their prey by playing dead and then commands Dondozo to attack.

All forms share the same basic physiology, with two large eyes, long pectoral fins, a wavy dorsal fin, and a split tail fin. All forms also have a white throat sac, which resembles a bed of rice when inflated; Tatsugiri inflates its throat sac to camouflage itself. The major difference between each form of Tatsugiri is its colors and the poses it makes. Curly Form Tatsugiri is orange with darker orange splotches all over its body and a white underbelly, and it often assumes an upcurled stance. Droopy Form Tatsugiri is mostly a pinkish-red, with white colorations on its belly and fins; true to its name, it tends to droop on its throat sac. Stretchy Form Tatsugiri is a solid yellow, except for its white throat sac; it assumes a straight, horizontal pose. It is said that Tatsugiri's various forms are an adaptation to suit the preferences of its prey.\nAlthough relatively weak, Tatsugiri is one of the most intelligent dragon Pok\u00e9mon. It baits prey such as bird Pok\u00e9mon by playing dead. When its prey approaches, Tatsugiri then commands its partner, Dondozo , to attack. The Dondozo follows the orders of its Tatsugiri partner loyally, and provides the Tatsugiri protection and shelter with its large mouth, in exchange for a greater chance at catching prey. Tatsugiri mainly resides near lakes, cliffs, and beaches.

It is also able to greatly increase the size of its unshackled arm. Annihilape has three-fingered hands and two-toed feet. There are multiple throbbing veins on the left side of its face, with a large pink pig-like snout as well. Its eyes are red as if the creature were in an extreme rage.\nAnnihilape evolved from Primeape when the rage in its soul became too much for its physical form to contain; it gained increased power as a result of its spirit no longer being limited by the flesh.

            "description": "Farigiraf is a quadrupedal giraffine Pok\u00e9mon. Its body is primarily orange with a long, brown neck and topside, yellow underside and lower legs, and black cloven hooves. Its main head has a yellow blaze on top, two yellow ossicones with bulbous tips, white eyes with black eyelashes and irises, pink upper eyelids, dark brown spots around its eyes, and a round, pink nose. This head is covered by Farigiraf's tail head, which has moved forward, hardened, and fused with its main head as it evolves from Girafarig . The tail head is dark brown with a black face, yellow eyes, sharp white teeth, and four ossicone-like antennae with bulbous tips. There are four orange spots on the front of Farigiraf's neck, and seven dark brown spots circling around where its neck meets its body. It has a row of eight dark brown and yellow spikes running down its spine. Since its tail head had migrated to its neck, Farigiraf lacks a visible tail.\nFarigiraf's two brains are connected through thick nerves, allowing it to increase its psychic energy and unleash psychic waves through its antennae. The increased psychic power is 10 times stronger than that of Girafarig. When Farigiraf uses its psychic powers, the eyes on its tail head glow a bright green. Farigiraf is always observing its surroundings and its brains can instantly detect danger. However, its body sometimes cannot react as quickly. [1]\nFarigiraf's thick, sturdy tail head serves as both offense and defense for the inner head. When attacking, Farigiraf closes its tail head before using its long neck for a brutal physical attack. This neck attack is powerful enough to destroy both stone and steel beams. [1]\nFarigiraf and its pre-evolved form are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Twin Beam . Farigiraf is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Armor Tail as an Ability .",

It has the same yellow body with a blue underside and blue and cream stripes on its back. It sports three \"prongs\" on its blue chin and its eyes are now partially opened up, revealing its two pupiless white colored scleras. It has a dark blue spiral pattern on the underside of its first body segment, and its tail has a blue \"cap\" on it.\nThe most notable change Dudunsparce has compared to its pre-evolution is that its body is longer, having gained segments that are similar to Dunsparce's original body. Two known variations are known to exist: Two-Segment Form and Three-Segment Form Dudunsparce. According to a study, Dudunsparce's number of segments is determined by its genes. Each segment has its own pair of wings and back pattern. Two-Segment Form Dudunsparce have two body segments, with two blue stripes and a pair of two-feathered wings on the first body segment, and one blue stripe and a pair of one-feathered wings on the second. Some Dudunsparce have the Three-Segment Form instead, which has an additional body segment after the head; this segment has three blue stripes and a pair of three-feathered wings.\nDudunsparce makes its nest, which can reach over six miles (10\u00a0km) long, by using its hard tail to bore holes into bedrock deep underground. It drives enemies out of its nest by inhaling air with its long, narrow lungs \u2014 enough to greatly inflate its first body segment \u2014 and then releasing it in an intense blast. However, it is also known to be gentle, and will carry Pok\u00e9mon wandering into its nest on its back and guide them outside.\nDudunsparce and its pre-evolved form are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Hyper Drill .",

            "description": "Kingambit is a humanoid Pok\u00e9mon whose appearance resembles a samurai. Its body is mostly red and black, with gold accents on its torso and helmet-like head. The blade on its head has grown tremendously from its time as a Bisharp , extending upward into a large machete shape with a sword-shaped indentation on it. It also has a large mustache composed of two black, red-lined blades, and two bright red circles on either side of its front torso. From its waist protrude two pairs of curved blades, somewhat resembling the omega (\u03a9) symbol. These curved blades surround Kingambit's body and its golden, ridged forearms. Additionally, Kingambit has long, curved, metallic black hair that completely shields its back, and is sturdy enough for it to sit on as well as ride upon. Kingambit can additionally form its prehensile hair into spikes to strike its foes with. As seen in HZ058 , Kingambit can float and hover above the ground to move about.\nCommanding many colonies of Pawniard and Bisharp as its personal army, Kingambit is a powerful force in battle. It has a battle-hungry disposition, and will not stop until it gets what it desires. However, it is not strategically adept, so it typically seeks to win its battles through brute force with sheer numbers. It is said that only the strongest Bisharp can evolve into Kingambit.\nKingambit is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Kowtow Cleave . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Supreme Overlord as an Ability .",

Similar pinkish-red accents form around its slanted yellow eyes, as well as on its body as spots. It also has tufts of pinkish-red fur around its legs. Its face has a jagged mouth and two large tusks that curl inward. Its dark purple ears are long, thin, and serrated, with red on the inside. Great Tusk has a savage nature. The Scarlet Book, which named the creature, describes how it attacked the Area Zero Expedition team with its large body and tusks, fatally injuring one of the explorers in the process.An article from a September issue of Occulture magazine describes Great Tusk as a mysterious life-form resembling Donphan, albeit one with gigantic tusks, tough scales, and an aggressive disposition. Unlike its present-day and future relatives, Great Tusk is never seen curling up into a ball, perhaps prevented by its enormous tusks. There is an unproven theory that the Great Tusk is a living relic of the dinosaur era. Great Tusk was the first Paradox Pok\u00e9mon to be discovered 200 years ago in Area Zero by the Area Zero Expedition team and recorded by Heath in his Scarlet Book. According to AI Sada, Great Tusk is an ancient Pok\u00e9mon related to Donphan. However, according to a Sada brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos, Great Tusk is a counterpart of Donphan from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Great Tusk were brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Sada ten years ago.",

It appears to have compound eyes that are two shades of red, and there is a red spiny horn-like structure on each side of its face. The fuzz on its body and legs is smoky white and messy. Its thorax is navy blue in the center, and its tail-like abdomen is teal with black dots. It has six leaf-like wings that are orange in color with yellow-orange tips and small green diamond-shaped marks, but they do not seem to be strong enough to allow it to fly. Even though it is mostly quadrupedal, it can stand on two legs, mostly during battles. In an article from an August issue of Occulture magazine, it is stated that there have been few sightings reported of Slither Wing, whose name is taken from that of a similar creature described in the Scarlet Book. It shares traits with Volcarona, and some theorize that it may have been revived from fossils of a prehistoric era. However, no Volcarona fossils of that era are known to have been found. According to AI Sada, Slither Wing is an ancient Pok\u00e9mon related to Volcarona.

Unlike Magneton, each eye blinks independently of one another and not in unison. The top unit bears markings similar to tribal war paint as well as iron filings on its body and horseshoe magnets that resemble hair. The bottom units have only a single magnet each, which is elongated in a manner that makes them resemble legs; they are also covered with iron filings on their ends. Instead of floating like Magneton, it walks by bending these magnets. A series of screws with iron filings on the end floats between the two lower units, making it resemble a tail. According to an article from a July issue of Occulture magazine, some scientists claim that Sandy Shocks is a Magneton that has lived for 10,000 years. It has allegedly been sighted numerous times in Paldea's more arid regions, but there are no reports of it ever having been caught. It is said to have an aggressive disposition and some people who have seen it claim to have been attacked. Sandy Shocks purportedly takes its name from a beast with a matching description in the Scarlet Book. According to AI Sada, Sandy Shocks is an ancient Pok\u00e9mon related to Magneton. However, according to a Sada brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos, Sandy Shocks is a counterpart of Magneton from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown.

On its face are a pair of short black tusks and a black half-moon pixelated screen, which usually displays a pattern of a pair of angry red eyes; underneath them is a metal plate that can be retracted to reveal its mouth. Its most prominent physical feature is a segmented tread jutting out from its back, and extending to the front of its face. This tread is black and has bright red glowing patterns accenting it. Iron Treads also has long black plate-like earlobes, and metal plates covering its legs, which can be retracted to aid in its rolling attacks. Iron Treads is said to have a cruel nature. It is capable of swiftly curling up its body and rolling like a wheel to attack. Iron Treads will additionally curl up into this form and rock itself back and forth when sleeping. The trails it leaves behind are described as similar to scorched earth.It also reportedly fatally injured one of the explorers of the Area Zero Expedition team in the past. In an article from a September issue of Occulture magazine, it is said that there have been reports of Iron Treads in an arid corner of Paldea. It is said to resemble Donphan. Rumors suggest that Iron Treads is some kind of weapon using technology not of this world, though this is unproven. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, curling itself into its wheel form and causing the red energy on its treads to turn black. Iron Treads was the first Paradox Pok\u00e9mon to be discovered 200 years ago in Area Zero by the Area Zero Expedition team and recorded by Heath in his Violet Book. According to AI Turo, Iron Treads is a future Pok\u00e9mon related to Donphan. However, according to a Turo brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos, Iron Treads is a counterpart of Donphan from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Iron Treads were brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Turo ten years ago.",

A metallic ring is visible around its neck (which hides a wire allowing it to extend its head over long distances), and its 'bag' is attached to its body by a black and blue cable. When running, it uses it's feet as if it was skiing. There are only two reported sightings of Iron Bundle.

An unproven theory suggests it is the product of a long-gone civilization, as supported by ancient writings that describe the design and usage of machines resembling the Iron Bundle.

            "description": "Iron Hands is a large, bulky cyborg Pok\u00e9mon that looks like a futuristic sumo wrestler. The head crest is a deep blue with ten black lines connecting across it. The head is light grey with cylinder-like ears. The two eyes are yellow within a black faceplate. The upper half of their body is colored light gray resembling a light armor gear with two bright yellow holes with white spots on each side of where the shoulder would be. Also connected to it is a grey belt with three yellow square armor-like pieces on each side with white spots as well. The lower half is grey with several black line markings. The half-sphere legs are colored dark blue which are connected to small yellow rectangles with white spots. The black feet are shaped like shoes with one small, yellow rectangle with white spots connected to each foot. It has two giant, three-fingered hands which it uses. The back side of their hands is light grey with a yellow circle in the center with three white spots each. The front is four large, bright yellow rectangles connected and black lines. The rectangles also have several white spots as well. According to an article from a May issue of Occulture magazine, Iron Hands got its name from an iron-handed entity described in the Violet Book. It is said to have fists that move independently of its body and to be capable of throwing large, fast-moving vehicles. An unproven theory claims that Iron Hands was once an athlete who became mortally wounded but was kept alive by being made into a cyborg. It strongly resembles Hariyama, though why this is remains unanswered. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, connecting its hands to its body and causing the yellow energy on its palms and armor pieces to turn black. According to AI Turo, Iron Hands is an future Pok\u00e9mon related to Hariyama. However, according to a Turo brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos, Iron Hands is a counterpart of Hariyama from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Iron Hands were brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Turo ten years ago.",

            "description": "Iron Jugulis is a three-headed, mechanical, draconic Pok\u00e9mon with six thin, pointed black wings with visible joints. Its body is primarily dark blue, with black armor plating resembling fur covering its necks and shoulders. The inner armor surrounding its head is fuchsia in color with white spots and resembles collars. The surfaces of Iron Jugulis' heads function as LED displays. When turned on, each of its heads glows blue with black eyes; the main head additionally has fuchsia pupils and visible pointed teeth formed from its armor plates. Like with the eyes of other future Paradox Pok\u00e9mon, Iron Jugulis' LED faces are used to display its emotions; unlike with Hydreigon, its secondary heads can emote in this manner as well. Its abdomen has two fuchsia stripes and its feet resemble fins. Its tail also sports a fuchsia stripe and ends with a black plate. An article from a July issue of Occulture magazine describes Iron Jugulis as a flying life-form resembling Hydreigon that has allegedly been seen in a certain corner of Paldea. It was reported to have razed an entire building with a high-energy blast before flying off as if to find its next objective. Iron Jugulis is theorized to be a sort of machine-Hydreigon hybrid, as it combines Hydreigon's ferocity with the ruthlessness of a machine. It is said that it takes its name from a similarly described entity in the Violet Book. It was shown to be capable of sending its arms wandering by themselves independently of its body and even shooting them like missiles against its enemies. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, causing the magenta energy on its neck plates, underbelly and tail, and the blue LED in its faces to turn black. According to AI Turo, Iron Jugulis is a future Pok\u00e9mon related to Hydreigon. However, according to a Turo brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos, Iron Jugulis is a counterpart of Hydreigon from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown.

It has four small 'feet', red compound eyes, red horns on the sides of its head, and white armor plating covering its thorax. Its abdomen is black and light blue with two black diamond spots on the outside. It has six diamond-shaped wings that are mostly orange with white speckles and a single black triangle marking, which levitate a short distance away from its body. In an article from an August issue of Occulture magazine, it is said that the name Iron Moth was borrowed from that of a flying object described in the Violet Book. Iron Moth is said to resemble Volcarona, and it would descend from the skies, following people around and occasionally attacking them. Some point to Iron Moth's aggression as evidence supporting that it may be a UFO controlled by alien life. It is speculated that something out there may be using Iron Moth to observe the people of the Pok\u00e9mon world in preparation for an invasion. In the TCG, it was shown to be capable of sending its 'legs' flying by themselves independently of its body. It has been seen releasing attacks from its six connected wings similarly to a cannon. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, connecting its wings to its back and causing the orange energy on its wings to turn black. According to AI Turo, Iron Moth is a future Pok\u00e9mon related to Volcarona.

Its head and facial features are large compared to the rest of its body, with eyes containing yellow sclerae and black pupils, a bulbous light gray snout with two nostrils, and a large mouth. On the left side below its lip is what appears to be a singular, square-shaped ice crystal. It has a light blue underbelly and a short tail. Its short, stubby limbs have three digits each, and it has a long, thin, yellow quill on the backs of each of its hands. As revealed HZ060 in Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series , Frigibax compare the sizes of their yellow quills to settle fights in the wild, with the one with the longest and more colorful quills winning.\nFrigibax has a triangular dorsal fin located atop a large, whitish circular pattern on its back. This fin absorbs heat, which Frigibax converts into ice energy. Frigibax stores the ice energy inside its body and uses it to cool its dwelling. It stores more ice energy the greater its surrounding temperatures are. Frigibax lives in forests and rough terrains, and fights with Bergmite whenever they meet.\nFrigibax and its evolutions are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Thermal Exchange as an Ability .",

The beads sometimes glow red and yellow when it attacks. Like the other treasures of ruin, Chi-Yu's true form is the beads forming its eyes, having been given life by the envy of those who desired them enough to start wars over them \u2014 while its body is a form it has constructed using its control over fire. Chi-Yu's flames burn at over 5,400 degrees Fahrenheit (3,000 degrees Celsius), allowing it to melt rock and sand into lava that it can swim through. It is known as the Beads of Ruin. Chi-Yu and the other treasures of ruin are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Ruination. Chi-Yu is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Beads of Ruin as an Ability.",

There are red markings on the underside of its tail, and stripes on the inner surface of its hind legs. Additionally, there are raised white ridges above its eyes. Jagged, light blue spikes protrude from either side of its head. Its mouth features sharp teeth, with a pair of three teeth on the upper jaw and a pair of single teeth in the lower. Each of its legs has three, long claws, with its front legs being longer and bulkier, and sporting three protruding scales close to the knees. On its back rests very large red wings that begin with a three-pronged yellow pattern on both sides, that then curl upward into a crescent moon-like shape which gives the Pok\u00e9mon its name, with blue-tipped feather-like protrusions on the ends. Below its wings is a jagged cape-like structure with a black underside. According to an article from an April issue of Occulture magazine, Roaring Moon is named after a similarly described being in the Scarlet Book. It looks similar to Salamence when they undergo Mega Evolution, but it's unclear if there is any connection. It's said that Roaring Moon scatters feathers as it flies around at high speeds seeking prey. It's thought to be more savage than Salamence and that it should be avoided at all costs. According to AI Sada, Roaring Moon is an ancient Pok\u00e9mon related to Salamence. However, according to a Sada at the Crystal Pool, Roaring Moon is a counterpart of Salamence from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Roaring Moon were brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Sada ten years ago.",

Its arms consist of gauntlets with large magenta blades protruding from the sides, which it can detach and combine to serve as a deadly double-edged weapon. Its head spikes outward twice from both sides and is covered by a green curved piece resembling hair with two cone-shaped structures at the back of its head, and a teal head crest, somewhat akin to a gladiator's helmet. A hollow magenta core serves as a centerpiece on its chest. Five petal-shaped white and green guards tinged with magenta at the ends adorn its torso, resembling a dress. According to an article from an April issue of Occulture magazine, Iron Valiant's name is borrowed from that of an object described in the Violet Book. An unproven theory claims that it is a robot built as the product of a mad scientist's efforts to create the most powerful psychic Pok\u00e9mon. According to eyewitnesses, Iron Valiant is similar in appearance to both Gardevoir and Gallade. It is also said to be a cruel Pok\u00e9mon, willing to take its shining blade and cut down anyone confronting it without hesitation. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, causing the pink energy on its 'ponytails', core, blades, feet and dress to turn black. According to AI Turo, Iron Valiant is a future Pok\u00e9mon related to both Gardevoir and Gallade. However, according to a Turo at the Crystal Pool, Iron Valiant is a counterpart of Gardevoir and Gallade from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown.

Koraidon's most prominent feature is the tire-like gular sac on its throat, which inflates and deflates between its different forms. Its head has a crest of feathers and a pair of long, thin, and twisted tendrils; similar feathers are also present on its lower back, around the beginning of its tail. These feathers are blue at the base, purple at the midsection, and white at the tip. Along the crest of feathers, there are singular red plumes near each of its eyes, giving the impression of eyebrows. Its eyes have yellow sclera, orange irises, and brown pupils. It has webbed feet, and blue features on its elbows and shoulders, as well as blue frills running down its neck. From each shoulder, a blue, curved handlebar-like structure protrude backwards. Each foot has four claws, but the two central ones are kept in close contact in some forms, making it appear that there are only three claws. Its gular sac and the base of its tail are both grooved and have similar texture, though its gular sac also has spikes on each section.\nKoraidon is aware of its own impressive strength and derives confidence from this fact, never feeling threatened by its opponents. It is capricious and curious enough to sometimes play with humans, despite usually being cautious of them. Overall, it shares many resemblances to the modern-day Cyclizar , although Koraidon is described as far more ferocious and burly. Koraidon as a species were brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Sada ten years ago. Unlike other Paradox Pok\u00e9mon , however, only two specimen were brought: a quirky, friendly one and a belligerent, territorial one . Despite this, its true origin is unknown: according to AI Sada , Koraidon is an ancient Pok\u00e9mon related to Cyclizar; however, a Sada brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos claims Koraidon to be a counterpart of Cyclizar from another timeline. It was known as the \" Winged King \" at the time the Scarlet Book was written; its modern-day name, Koraidon, was coined by Professor Sada, possibly as a result of a bootstrap paradox . [1]\nThe rest of Koraidon's ecology and other details regarding it is unknown.\nKoraidon is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Collision Course . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Orichalcum Pulse as an Ability .",

            "description": "Miraidon is a large, robotic reptilian Pok\u00e9mon . In general, its body is mostly metallic violet, though its face, neck, abdomen, tail, and knee joints are silver, and its claws are white. Miraidon's most prominent feature is the gular sac on its throat, whose appearance changes between its different forms. Its head has a small, dark purple casque similar in appearance to a motorcycle's windshield and circular purple cheeks. Its eyes resemble a LED display : the sclerae and pupils are black, while the irises are composed of the pixels. Miraidon is capable of simulating blinking by changing the pattern displayed. Two small, connected silver plates border each eye, giving the impression of eyelids, from where a pair of long antennae extend. From each shoulder, a curved handlebar-like structure protrude backwards. On its lower back, right above the beginning of its tail, there is a black structure similar to a rear fender . Each foot has three claws, with the central one having a vertical black line in the middle. Its tail and throat are grooved like a tire tread .\nWhile apparently accustomed to humans, Miraidon uses its power of insight and observation to carefully judge a person's character before it decides whether to join them or not. It has a calm and collected disposition, and it is very difficult for others to tell what it is thinking or feeling due to its robotic nature, with the only available hints presented in its eyes. In spite of its mechanical nature, Miraidon seems to possess some sort of digestive system, as it is able to eat the Herba Mystica sandwiches and regain its strength throughout the Path of Legends storyline; furthermore, Pok\u00e9mon Adventures has shown that Miraidon has a robotic tongue, similar in aspect to its gular sac. Overall, it shares many resemblances to the modern-day Cyclizar , although Miraidon is described as far more powerful and ruthless. Miraidon as a species were brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Turo ten years ago. Unlike other Paradox Pok\u00e9mon , however, only two specimen were brought: a quirky, friendly one and a belligerent, territorial one . Despite this, its true origin is unknown: according to AI Turo , Miraidon is a future Pok\u00e9mon related to Cyclizar; however, a Turo brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos claims Miraidon to be a counterpart of Cyclizar from another timeline. It was known as the \" Iron Serpent \" at the time the Violet Book was written; its modern-day name, Miraidon, was coined by Professor Turo, possibly as a result of a bootstrap paradox . [1]\nThe rest of Miraidon's ecology and other details regarding it is unknown.\nMiraidon is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Electro Drift . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Hadron Engine as an Ability .",

The horizontal eyes are red, with yellow sclerae with red skin surrounding them. Its face and underside are also white as well. It has a thick, large purple mane covering its arms and back. The mane resembles the aurora borealis with six tips of spiky hair being red and orange. It has two small light blue forelimbs, with three white-clawed digits each, and one diamond marking. Walking Wake has two powerful light blue hind legs with six feathers, and three white claws each. It has a large, hexagonal, cerulean blue crest on its forehead with two bent prongs on either side of the base. It has a blue horn between the snout and crest. It has two long, white tails with seven small spikes each. The tails also have eight blue spikes marking on the tops of two tails each. Walking Wake resembles a sketch made by a member of the Area Zero Expedition in the Scarlet Book. Its name originated from an aquatic monster mentioned in the Scarlet Book. It bears a uniquely shaped set of horns on its forehead. It also supports its weight with just its hind legs and walks bipedally. Walking Wake is capable of walking on water. According to an illustration in the Occulture, Walking Wake is believed to be a super-ancient Suicune from the past. According to AI Sada, Walking Wake is an ancient Pok\u00e9mon related to Suicune. However, according to a Sada brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos, Walking Wake is a counterpart of Suicune from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Walking Wake was brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Sada ten years ago. Walking Wake is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Hydro Steam.",

It has a sliver snout with a bright red blaze running from its horn to the back of its head, with white spots inside of the blaze. The eyes are bright digital red. Iron Leaves's face, neck, hind legs, and underside are grey. The grey parts of its body have several dark grey lines connecting to different parts. The neck is covered by three green circles of armor. The middle circle has a green-tipped leaf on each side of its neck connected to a small green circle. The leaves have a bright red tip and white spots. The upper half of the body has a green armor plating, connected to three pointed tufts of fur forming a medium-long tail and two large spikes on each side of the tail. The front legs connect to green armor with three leafy tufts shaped like wings and green cylinder armor with a half-circle tip. The hind legs are connected to green leg armor. Its four legs resemble knee-high, green armor boots with bright red diamond highlights at the knees with white spots. The legs end in black hooves. Iron Leaves resembles a sketch made by a member of the Area Zero Expedition in the Violet Book. According to Occulutre, its appearance resembles a Virizion from the future. It has a smooth, glossy body that has a metallic texture, and the glowing parts on its forehead and leaves can transform to look like longswords[1]. These swords are actually ethereal blades used to rend its targets. These shining swords are also powerful enough to cut large trees and boulders into short, thin strips. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, causing the red energy on its head, leaves, and legs to turn black. According to AI Turo, Iron Leaves is a future Pok\u00e9mon related to Virizion.

The head belongs to the \" fore-wyrm \" while the tail belongs to the \" core-wyrm \". Both of Dipplin's bodies are light green, with a yellow-green underside. The fore-wyrm's head has two large yellow leaf-like eyestalks with small black pupils, and a tall, thin protrusion similar to a horn or an antenna. The core-wyrm's tail that sticks out from Dipplin's rear has two leaf-like features on it.\nDipplin's evolution is said to have been triggered by the Syrupy Apple , found exclusively in Kitakami . The pair that composes Dipplin works together inside their shared apple. They are capable of producing syrup, which they use to coat their apple in layers. This syrup has a fragrant scent that captivates Dipplin's opponents. They can use the syrup to engulf their opponents and hinder them.

            "description": "Poltchageist is a Pok\u00e9mon made of matcha tea powder that inhabits a tea caddy ; specifically a \u8336\u5165 chaire , a kind used in the traditional Japanese tea ceremony . The tea caddy is primarily black and white, with a white lid, a sealed crack near the top, and a painted pattern resembling a face. Poltchageist is always seen carrying a \u8336\u6753 chashaku , the tea scoop used to transfer tea powder into the tea bowl in the aforementioned tea ceremony.\nPoltchageist heavily resembles Sinistea , although they are not biologically related. On top of its matcha body, just below its lid, is a yellow swirl pattern similar to the one found on Sinistea. On Sinistea, this swirl pattern serves as its weak spot and will cause it to become dizzy if stirred; however, this is not the case for Poltchageist. [1]\nAccording to an old tale, Poltchageist was born from the regrets of an old tea master, who was so obsessed with perfecting the art of the tea ceremony that he drove away everyone around him. Poltchageist is more active at night than during the day, prowling around towns and their outskirts. By day, Poltchageist dwells in cool, dark places \u2014 usually in old houses, which is its favorite. [1]\nPoltchageist tends to scatter its matcha powder on people and food. If someone touches or ingests the powder, they will notice their skin apparently glowing for a brief moment, before they fall unconscious as their life force is sapped away by the powder for Poltchageist to use as energy. It is capable of draining energy in this way from many people at once. Another behavior exhibited by Poltchageist is its strong tendency to repair broken objects and seal cracks by filling them in with its matcha powder. [2]\nPoltchageist and its evolved form, Sinistcha , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Hospitality as an Ability .",

Its arms are thin and its hands have three digits, and it has two small legs. It inhabits a \u8336\u7897 chawan , a tea bowl used in the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. The chawan it inhabits is black and white, with a few cracks sealed with green all over it, and a swirling, face-like pattern on its side. Atop its head, Sinistcha wears a \u8336\u7b45 chasen (a bamboo whisk used to prepare and stir matcha tea) , which is broken and missing a few of its teeth. Despite appearances, Sinistcha is not biologically related to Polteageist .\nSinistcha lives in cool, dark areas such as the back of a shelf or beneath a house's floorboards. In the past, Sinistcha would sneak into houses and pretend to be tea in order to trick people into drinking it, so it can absorb their life force. However, because the chawan Sinistcha inhabits had fallen out of use, this act became largely unsuccessful. In recent times, instead of sneaking into houses, Sinistcha roams towns and suburbs in search of prey. It is generally active after sunset, and will attack anything that approaches it with a life-force-draining splash of tea. In order to prepare itself for battle, Sinistcha builds up its energy by using the chasen on its head to stir itself. [1]\nSinistcha is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Matcha Gotcha . Additionally, Sinistcha and its pre-evolved form, Poltchageist , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Hospitality as an Ability .",

            "description": "Fezandipiti is an avian Pok\u00e9mon with a small head, a short beak with a magenta tip, and a long neck and legs. Its plumage is primarily black, with white on its head and neck, and bronze accents on its face, collar, and wing tips. It stands atop a pair of long slender bronze-colored legs having three-toed feet with sharp claws, and its tail consists of a long train of bronze-colored feathers ending in forked tips that gently curl outwards. A single white stripe accents each of its legs and tail. A crest of black feathers resembling a cap sits atop Fezandipiti's head, with golden feathers sticking out resembling a royal crown. A pair of magenta plumes also sits just above each of Fezandipiti's eyes like eyebrows and extend like long streamers with forked ends. Hanging from Fezandipiti's chest is a pair of magenta Toxic Chains , protruding from a shawl-like feature that wraps its body. Fezandipiti is a male-only species with no female counterpart.\nIn myth, it is said that Fezandipiti was once a Pok\u00e9mon with short, dull feathers , but a wish to be beautiful led it meet the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Pecharunt , in need of retainers in its journey to Kitakami , used its Binding Mochi and Toxic Chain to tame and transform Fezandipiti. This resulted in the Toxic Chain being wrapped around its waist, chaining Fezandipiti to Pecharunt's will. Fezandipiti transformed, enhancing its capabilities and giving it beautiful looks and a lovely voice. It possesses powerful pheromones, capable of captivating both humans and Pok\u00e9mon with a beat of its glossy wings to scatter them through the air. It traveled from a distant land with Munkidori , Okidogi , and Pecharunt to steal the masks of Ogerpon and its partner and gift them to Pecharunt's caretakers, Okidogi and Fezandipiti were sent to sneak into Ogerpon's cave while the two were away, managing to steal three of them, but Ogerpon's partner return in time to see what was happening and fend them off, managing to protect one of the masks, though left heavily injured. After finding out, Ogerpon encounters the four close to Mossui Town , and attacks them, Fezandipiti losing its life in the fight along with the other retainers. Pecharunt managed to survive, being knocked out and sent rolling away inside its shell. To the villagers of Mossui Town, it looked like the trio had fallen protecting the village from the enraged ogre, nicknaming them the Loyal Three and giving them a proper burial while Ogerpon retreated to Oni Mountain .\nFezandipiti, together with Okidogi and Munkidori, are known as the Loyal Three , the heroes of Kitakami. The three are beloved by the people of Kitakami as heroes that once protected the land from the \"evil ogre\", and stone statues bearing their likenesses were made by the people as an expression of their gratitude right where the three had been buried. According to locals, worshiping Fezandipiti leads to both good luck and serendipitous things happening. Even with its greedy and arrogant personality, Fezandipiti has great relationships with its teammates, talking to each other in private and acting together to defeat their opponents. By consuming the Kitakami Mochis, Fezandipiti can become a Titanic Pok\u00e9mon .",

            "description": "Ogerpon is a predominantly green, humanoid Pok\u00e9mon . Its green torso is spotted with white flowers and yellow dots, and it is capable of extending green and black vines of ivy. Its long legs are black in the front and white in the back, and its two-toed feet each have two green leaves sprouting between the toes. Its torso is mostly covered by a large, green, multicolored cloak-like structure that extends from a stem on top of its head. This cloak frames its face with a large, black, thorny vine, the two uppermost thorns resembling horns. While the cloak's sleeves move as if Ogerpon has arms beneath them, it actually has no arms or even shoulders; the cloak itself is prehensile and serves as its arms, with the \"sleeves\" able to grasp and manipulate objects. Ogerpon can also extend a prehensile branch and vine from its torso. Ogerpon has an orange face, yellow eyes with white, star-shaped pupils and small green leaves at the edges that loosely resemble eyelashes, a three-pointed leaf that serves as hair, small black markings on its eyebrows and cheeks, and two pointed fangs in its upper jaw. Its face is usually hidden behind one of its masks , and in battle, it wields a large, spiky cudgel wrapped in ivy ; these tools are stored under its cloak when not in use. Ogerpon is a female-only species with no male counterpart.\nOgerpon is a very intelligent Pok\u00e9mon with a playful mischief-loving side. It's full of curiosity about the lives of people and other Pok\u00e9mon, usually spending time with humans while wearing a mask to blend in with them in Kitakami 's Festival of Masks . Usually causing trouble, such as by stealing snacks from the village \u2019s food supply or making off with items that caught its eye. It fights by confusing its opponents with its nimble movements and kicks, and it draws type -based energy from its masks, imbuing its cudgel with different elements. Ogerpon becomes weaker if its masks are taken away, and its full power can be restored to it by returning its masks. By using any of its masks, Ogerpon is capable of Terastallizing itself without the need of a Tera Orb , supposedly due to the masks being made of Tera crystals , just like Tera Orbs. This species is known to have a very long lifespan; one specimen is confirmed to have been alive for hundreds of years. Ogerpon is mortal enemies with the Loyal Three and their leader Pecharunt , mainly due to the group's actions towards it in the past. In Kitakami myths, it is described as \" the ogre \".\nOgerpon is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of using the move Ivy Cudgel . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Embody Aspect as an Ability in any of its Terastallized states .",

            "description": "Archaludon is a tall, metallic, bipedal dinosaur-like Pok\u00e9mon with an angular, cuboid body bent at its chest and hips. Its body is primarily cool gray, although it has dark blue colorations on its palms and soles, as well as dark blue platings on its face and underside. The underside plating has criss-crossing patterns on the torso, and two red stripes at the bottom, with three small notches on each of them. This plating extends past Archaludon's head at the sides, forming horn-like features tipped with red. There is a continuous protrusion running the length of Archaludon's spine, three pairs of zigzag patterns on its sides, and spikes on the back of its head and the tip of its large tail.\nArchaludon's head is small compared to its body and is sunken into its neck. The plating on its face is T-shaped with a few indents on the sides, and folds down the middle to partially cover its yellow eyes. Its mouth, shaped into a permanent scowl, opens at the upper jaw and contains a grooved copper-colored tube, which it uses to fire beams to attack. When it closes its mouth, the tube is concealed and resembles teeth.\nArchaludon's hands and feet are large and V-shaped, each of which are connected to cuboid forelimbs and have two rectangular digits. On these hands and feet, Archaludon has tall, retractable spires near the joints, with the spires on its feet usually retracted. These spires contain pointed, yellow terminals at their tips, which gather and store static electricity from Archaludon's surroundings, as it is incapable of producing electricity on its own. Similar terminal pairs are found on the spikes on Archaludon's head and tail.\nWhen Archaludon faces danger, it will get down on all fours, straighten its body, retract its limbs, and fully extend the spires on its hands and feet, forming a shape that resembles a steel bridge. This position allows for less mobility but offers Archaludon a sturdier center of gravity. In this position, Archaludon is capable of using the static electricity stored in its terminals to fire a tremendously powerful beam of electric energy . When Archaludon charges up to fire this beam, electrical energy connects the terminals on its head, tail, and limbs, in a similar fashion to bridge suspension cables. During storms and other inclement weather, Archaludon's terminals can gather static electricity more easily, allowing it to fire off its beam much faster. Archaludon's defensive capabilities are so strong that it cannot be fazed by a cave-in. Archaludon often digs holes in the mountains while searching for food.\nArchaludon and its pre-evolved form, Duraludon , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Stalwart as an Ability . Additionally, Archaludon is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Electro Shot .",

            "description": "Hydrapple is a Pok\u00e9mon composed of seven symbiotic creatures known as \" syrpents \" living within an apple-shaped structure completely made of red syrup. Each syrpent has green, leaf-shaped eyestalks with yellow eyes; a long green body with a pale yellow underbelly; and a tail tipped with leafy green ornaments.\nThree of the seven syrpents are always visible outside of the syrup apple: the central syrpent, which is the dominant entity in the system, rises from the center of the apple; and two of the syrpents' tails emerge from its rear. The central syrpent has the longest body and is further distinguished by its two horns. The left horn has an apple impaled on it, which appears to be the same apple that the Pok\u00e9mon inhabited when it was an Applin . The four other syrpents composing Hydrapple are usually hidden within the syrup, with only the tops of their closed eyestalks visible from without. Sometimes, the four hidden syrpents emerge from the syrup so that five of Hydrapple's heads are visible. To move, Hydrapple's two tail syrpents work together to push its entire body across the ground.\nThe seven syrpents that form Hydrapple have inconstant and fickle temperaments, and rarely work together as a team. On the rare occasion that the syrpents' moods align, Hydrapple unleashes its full power. [1]\nHydrapple and its pre-evolution Dipplin , are the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Syrup Bomb and the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Supersweet Syrup as an Ability . Hydrapple is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Fickle Beam .",

There is cream belly fur on its chest. It has five grey spikes on its back and a long, light gray cloud of smoke running along its entire back, resembling a tail. Gouging Fire has four gray paws. The two front paws house three small, red claws. The paws are covered with brown pads and two black cuff-like bands on its front legs and the back legs have only one. Its main faceplate is red and shaped like fins or a four-sided star with a golden ceratopsian-shaped skull headpiece. Behind the faceplate is two long brown fur with gold ends on each side of the hair. The headpiece has five gold and yellow horns on each side. At the center is two green circles with two smaller red circles inside. A gray plate, resembling a horseshoe mustache, covers its muzzle. It has shorter green fur around its blue eyes. Gouging Fire is noteworthy for the large, spiky crest on its head. There are scant few reports of this creature being sighted, though one short video shows it rampaging and spouting pillars of flame. It resembles an eerie Pok\u00e9mon once shown once in Occulture, and it was said to be an Entei regenerated from a fossil, though its rumored that Gouging Fire can make magma on the ground erupt by roaring once. Another rumor claims Gouging Fire has a powerful connection to fire. Gouging Fire can superheat its fur to both protect itself and burn any foes that make physical contact with it. According to AI Sada, Gouging Fire is an ancient Pok\u00e9mon related to Entei. However, according to a Sada brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos, Gouging Fire is a counterpart of Entei from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Gouging Fire was brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Sada ten years ago. Gouging Fire is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Burning Bulwark.",

Raging Bolt's face is covered by a circle mane across its back that resembles dull purple rain clouds. The mane can extend to form a normal-looking mane. It's said to incinerate everything around it with lightning launched from its fur, and it is rumored that Raging Bolt does this by covering the skies with dark clouds before using its neck to strike down targets with crashing lighting, yet very little is known about this creature.

It has a black, rounded forehead adorned with two brown, rotatable, axe-like horns that curve forward. The edge of the horns and the top of the head are colored bright orange blaze. The horns can transform into rounded blade cleaves when attacking. The blades can extend to the width of its head. Its face is grey with digital orange eyes and a short, metal snout. On top of its head are several short spikes. Down its back are two black, spine ridges that join just past its shoulders. It has a black circle surrounding its head. There are two orange metal protrusions on its shoulders. The orange blaze bands around its legs are the same color as its horns and forehead. It has grey metal hooves underneath these bands. Its striped underside is also beige. The grey parts of its body have several dark grey lines connecting to different parts. It has a short, stubby metal tail. Iron Boulder is capable of rotating its head. Iron Boulder is noteworthy for its metallic body. Iron Boulder stores laser energy within its sharp horns and was said to have once been an ordinary Terrakion modified by a villainous organization. Iron Boulder uses the charged energy within its axe horns to plow through anything within Iron Boulder's path[1]. The laser energy comes from the light it gathers and stores within its head[2]. It can wield the light that has accumulated atop its head to cleave its target. The name Iron Boulder originated from the mysterious object recorded in Violet Book as it was first discovered in Area Zero. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, causing the orange energy on its head, horns, and feet to turn black. According to AI Turo, Iron Boulder is a future Pok\u00e9mon related to Terrakion. However, according to a Turo brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos, Iron Boulder is a counterpart of Terrakion from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Iron Boulder was brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Turo ten years ago. Iron Boulder is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Mighty Cleave.",

            "description": "Iron Crown is an armored turquoise Pok\u00e9mon resembling a robotic goat. The eyes are bright digital blue. The top of its luminous head has two yellow metal horns similar in shape to drills, with luminous patches that extend from the upper half of the horn. The metal snout is gray, and there is a luminous blaze running from its nose to the back of its head. The back of the head has a headpiece with a circle connected by two rectangle pieces. On its long neck and hind legs, there are small luminous spots. It has several other luminous patches on its body, emitting a faint blue aura. Iron Crown's face, parts of its neck, and underside are grey. The grey parts of its body have several dark grey lines connecting to different parts. On its shoulder blades are yellow metal protrusions that resemble fins. Iron Crown's legs are connected by four-leg armor parts. The lower legs have a luminous v-shape brand connecting to light armor and metal hooves. Iron Crown is capable of rotating its head. Discovered in Area Zero, it is unknown what kind of Pok\u00e9mon Iron Crown actually is.It resembles a mysterious object introduced in Occulture as a cutting-edge weapon shaped like a Cobalion. There was supposedly an incident in which it launched shining blades from its distinctive horns to mow down everything around it to pieces, though little else is known about it[2]. The glowing parts on its horns can create two long bright blue blades that can extend before bending at the end. These swords can launch particle blades at its target twice in a row. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, causing the cyan energy on its head, horns, and legs to turn black. According to AI Turo, Iron Crown is a future Pok\u00e9mon related to Cobalion. However, according to a Turo brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos, Iron Crown is a counterpart of Cobalion from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Iron Crown was brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Turo ten years ago. Iron Crown is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Tachyon Cutter.",

            "description": "In its Normal Form, Terapagos is a small reptilian Pok\u00e9mon that resembles an indigo tortoise . Its head, legs, and tail stem from a cyan, hexagonal shell with the Terastal symbol on its back: a white hexagon with triangular extensions on each corner that connects it to the edges of its back. Its neck and legs each have a cyan four-pointed star and ring rub on them. Its feet each have three toes, and its tail has a cyan four-pointed star at its tip. It has two light blue eyes with rouge rimming and four-pointed star-shaped pupils. It has a diamond-like pattern on its forehead and two diamonds hanging like earrings on both sides of its head. lastly, it has a \"ponytail\" made up of three segments of diamond-like shapes. The segments reduce in size as they get farther from the head and gain a purplish tint to them.\nNormal Form Terapagos is said to have a splendid aura. It is a small and particularly weak Pok\u00e9mon, but it is capable of assuming a dormant state when it needs to slumber or when its life is in danger, pulling its head, limbs, and tail into its shell and shrinking in size, which makes itself look like an ordinary jewel. It also has the ability to crystallize the energy in its body to form a protective shield around itself when necessary, even in its dormant state. As depicted in Pok\u00e9mon Horizons: The Series , in its Normal Form, Terapagos is shown to be unable to move if it's turned upside down, needing outside help to stand back up. it has shown to have an incredibly long lifespan, with one known to have lived for millions of years while slumbering within its shell. Terapagos inhabited the Paldea region in a bygone era. It was thought that this species went extinct, with it said to have been caught up in seismic shifts that occurred about 2,000,000 years ago. However, one of them managed to survive by crystallizing its own body and going into hibernation in the Area Zero Underdepths , where it laid low until the present day. According to Briar , Terapagos is made of Terastal energy . Terapagos stays in its Normal Form while not battling, implying it to be its true form.\nHeath is the one who discovered Terapagos and coined its name. Professor Sada S / Professor Turo V did research on this Pok\u00e9mon while in Area Zero . Terapagos appears to naturally cause glowing crystals to form around it as it slumbers thanks to its ability to transform its own energy into hard crystals, which gave Area Zero the distinctive appearance it possesses. For a long time, many thought Terapagos was fake and that Heath had made it up, but Briar proved its existence by writing her own book: \" The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero \", which details the expedition she, Carmine , Kieran , and the player had in Area Zero Underdepths.\nThe Area Zero journals and the Scarlet Book S / Violet Book V imply that Terapagos is responsible for the Terastal phenomenon , which is confirmed to be the case in the Pok\u00e9dex . With the power of its crystals, Terapagos can bombard its foes with countless star-shaped projectiles . Terapagos also has the ability to alter timelines in some capacity, as seen in both games and anime, it is capable of bringing humans , Pok\u00e9mon , and objects either from other points in the Pok\u00e9mon world 's timeline or from other timelines altogether to the point in time and space it currently is. While using this ability, a pink mist appears around the affected area; once it disappears, whatever was brought is sent back. The true limits of this power are currently unknown, but it affects humans and objects differently, as the player was able to keep the copy of the Scarlet Book S /Violet Book V given by the professor after the encounter at Kitakami 's Crystal Pool . As revealed in The Plan to Capture Rayquaza , Terapagos has the ability to call out to other Pok\u00e9mon with a specific energy signal. Due to the Terastal energy its body produces, Terapagos was responsible for allowing advanced technologies, such as Tera Orbs , the professor's AI copy , and the \" time machine \", to exist in spite of human limitations. It is also implied to be responsible for the growth of Herba Mystica , special herbs with amazing healing properties and even the ability to make Pok\u00e9mon grow into Titan Pok\u00e9mon .\nTera Orbs directly exposed to the energy from Terapagos will gain the ability Terastallize Pok\u00e9mon with no charging drawbacks. Terapagos is also the source and creator of the Stellar type , a unique type that's exclusive to the Terastal phenomenon. It works differently from others, containing the powers of each and every type . The Stellar Tera Type used to occur only in the Area Zero Underdepths as a result of the Terapagos that slumbered there. However, due to the crystals found there, it can now be found in Blueberry Academy 's Terarium as well. Unlike other Pok\u00e9mon, Terapagos will always receive the full benefits of the Stellar Tera Type, even outside of Tera Raid Battles . Through the Stellar type, Terapagos can also change its defensive typing during the battle.\nTerapagos is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Tera Starstorm . Its Normal Form is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Tera Shift as an Ability . Its Tera Type is fixed as Stellar and cannot be changed at the Treasure Eatery .",

            "description": "Pecharunt is a small Pok\u00e9mon resembling a piece of mochi . It has two forms it can take both inside and outside of battle. The first form resembles an upside-down peach, with a black circular face at the center and a thin, vertical line splitting its body into two halves. In its face are two white semicircle eyes, appearing to be frowning. It takes its second form upon opening up, revealing a smaller inner body resembling a peach's pit. It has a darker purple and pink body with two white eyes which are usually frowning, below which is a white, ribbon-shaped mouth. On its head rests two purple flaps and a scorpion-like ponytail. It has two heart-shaped paws at the bottom of its body, along with three black dots on each side underneath them. The discarded shell floats on both sides of Pecharunt, forming spiky wing-like appendages. The inside of these shells have a bright pink glow, outlined in black. The bright pink extends slightly through the black outline in six thin lines. The chains have a magenta color to them and are divided in identical segments, ending in a slightly larger segment with two protrusions, making it resemble the shape of Pecharunt's shell.\nAccording to the player , Pecharunt smells incredibly sweet. It is known to feign weakness by weeping, and acting like a baby in order to gain sympathy from others. If mortally wounded, Pecharunt will retreat into its shell and remain asleep for years so it can regain its strength. After being knocked out in Kitakami , it started being known as the \" Never-Rotting Peach \" due to its peach-like shell.\nPecharunt stores poison in its peach-shaped shell and uses it to create toxic chains and roll up poisonous Binding Mochi , which are stored in its shell until they are needed. It is able to use its toxic chains in combat , badly poisoning its enemies in the process. The chains are also capable of empowering other Pok\u00e9mon, using its toxins to enhance certain aspects of their bodies, such as their muscles, brain, or looks, as seen with Okidogi , Munkidori , and Fezandipiti , respectively. It serves its mochi to Pok\u00e9mon and humans , but may also shoot them at their mouths if necessary. According to Penny , the mochi that Pecharunt creates are somewhat sweet. The mochi draw out their deepest desires and powers, but the ones who eat it become chained to Pecharunt's will, as seen with its caretakers, who had their greed drawn out. In some cases, the ones that eat it may completely fall under its control, as seen with Mossui Town 's residents and the player's friends from Paldea .\nHumans under Pecharunt's control have purple eyes and are surrounded by a purple aura. The controlled humans also hold their arms while performing a chicken dance-like movement, repeating the word \"mochi\" constantly. However, in some cases, like with Hideko , it is shown that the possessed human can still speak somewhat freely, though it may simply be Pecharunt influencing the propagation of the mochi among humans. Humans under its influence are often still prone to innate emotion and desires \u2014 Arven is visibly embarrassed while dancing, Penny instinctively combines the word \"mochi\" with \"Veevee\", and Nemona still expresses a strong urge to battle, being able to morph \"mochi\" into \"match\". It can even command humans, and Pok\u00e9mon to fight for it in battles, capable of controlling multiple creatures at once. It relies on others to fight for it due to its cowardly personality and size. However, Pecharunt will fight back if it is has no other option. Capturing Pecharunt will free those under its control with no memories of being controlled. The effect of Pecharunt's mochi on people are likened by Kieran to a curse.\nAccording to myth, Pecharunt came from a distant land where it was adopted by an elderly couple with no children. Pecharunt fed its adoptive parents Binding Mochi to secure their affection, which brought out their inner greed. They made many requests of Pecharunt, who gave them what they requested to be showered with further attention. The couple eventually asked for a brilliant set of masks , which could only be found in Kitakami. Pecharunt left to obtain the masks, recruiting Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti to aid in its quest. They successfully stole three masks from Ogerpon , who defeated and slayed the Loyal Three in retaliation; Pecharunt only survived by going dormant within its shell. It would not surface found again until hundreds of years later when a Mythical Pecha Berry awoke it.\nPecharunt is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Malignant Chain . It is also the only known Pok\u00e9mon that can have Poison Puppeteer as an Ability .",

Typically, there is a purple stripe running down the center of its face and a purple, crystalline organ in its chest. Its white, circular eyes are set inside rectangular, black eye sockets. As shown in Destiny Deoxys, some Deoxys can have a green crystalline organ and facial stripe. While in its Attack Forme, Deoxys's legs remain tapered. However, its blue stripes are no longer segmented and run the entire length of the leg and there is now a large spike on the knee. Two pairs of whip-like tentacles with pointed tips, one reddish-orange and one blue, replace its previous coiled, blunted tentacles. The protrusions on its head are now triangular with an additional one extending from the top of its head. Most of its reddish-orange skin has receded, revealing a striated, black chest and abdomen. Finally, its tail is now longer and more pointed.",

Typically, there is a purple stripe running down the center of its face and a purple, crystalline organ in its chest. Its white, circular eyes are set inside rectangular, black eye sockets. As shown in Destiny Deoxys, some Deoxys can have a green crystalline organ and facial stripe. Deoxys's Defense Forme has bulky, wide legs that are somewhat flat at the end with a bluish-green spot on each knee. It retains its two pairs of red and blue tentacles, but they are now flat and broad. The head has fused with its body and all protrusions are gone, causing it to resemble a helmet. The reddish-orange skin now covers the entire body, so none of its inner black portions are visible. There is now a single blue stripe on each shoulder, and its tail has disappeared.",

The fur on its back becomes a mohawk, and it has a red flower petal on the left side of its neck, resembling a scarf or cape. It has flat, white ears resembling wings, a small tuft of fur on the front of its neck, and a stumpy tail. The blooming of Gracidea flowers confers the power of flight upon Shaymin, transforming it into its Sky Forme. It reverts to Land Forme at night or if it is frozen. Sky Forme Shaymin has a courageous, energetic, and playful personality. It spreads feelings of gratitude when it takes flight. Sky Forme Shaymin has a deeper voice than Land Forme.",

            "description": "Giratina is a large gray draconic Pok\u00e9mon with three gold half-rings on each side of its long neck. Its head has a gold crown-like object surrounding it with two large horns pointing sideways. A thick black stripe runs vertically along its front with five red horizontal stripes. In its Altered Forme, it has two large black ghostly wings with three red tips on each that can resemble claws. These wings can change shape as if made of a liquid or gas. Its six legs are thick and have golden claws. Two golden half-circles similar to those on its neck are on each side of each leg, resembling shackles. It has a tail with two band-like markings. Giratina remains in its Altered Forme when outside of its home dimension. It generally moves by levitating itself in the air, as opposed to walking on its six legs. According to the myths and legends of the Hisui/Sinnoh region, in the beginning of time, the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Arceus created the Pok\u00e9mon of antimatter\u2013Giratina, the Pok\u00e9mon of time\u2013Dialga, and the Pok\u00e9mon of space\u2013Palkia, all three in their Origin Formes. After the Pok\u00e9mon universe was created, due to Giratina's violent nature, Arceus banished it to a world on the reverse side of the Pok\u00e9mon world, the Distortion World. Giratina is a highly aggressive and territorial Pok\u00e9mon that is protective of its home. It has also been reported to appear in ancient cemeteries. As seen in Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus, Giratina has the power to tear a hole in reality, creating a space-time rift along with driving both Dialga and Palkia berserk. The rift also causes huge lightnings that drive noble Pok\u00e9mon into a frenzied state. It is also capable of cloaking itself in darkness as it attacks. Giratina is said to be equal in strength to Dialga and Palkia. Giratina at one point carried a large grudge against its creator Arceus and was willing to stand against it with the help of a human named Volo, but after being beaten by a human from another time and fleeing, it would start to change its ways and protect the universe from threats such as Cyrus. Due to its typically violent nature, the history of Giratina was covered up due to ancient people fearing it. Giratina is said to have observed the real world silently while in its home dimension. As depicted in Giratina and the Sky Warrior, Giratina can also open portals through any reflective surface. Giratina's role is to keep both worlds in balance. Giratina also had many different titles, the banished Pok\u00e9mon, Arceus's shadow, the Pok\u00e9mon of Shadows, and the being on the other side of our world. Giratina is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Shadow Force by leveling up, which gives it the ability to temporarily turn invisible. Giratina can change between its Altered Forme and Origin Forme. Compared to Palkia and Dialga, both of which resemble Arceus in their Origin Formes, Giratina's Origin Forme takes on a serpentine look. Its legs are reduced to golden-tipped spikes, and four additional golden spikes appear near the edge of its tail. While in Origin Forme, the six gold half-rings can grip objects. The back points of each half-ring have a black ghostly tendril with a red spike at its tip. The horns on its head are now facing the back. The sides of the golden 'crown' cover its mouth and separate vertically like an insect's mandible when it opens its mouth. The black vertical stripe is broken into pieces and runs down its body. The Origin Forme of Giratina is said to be Giratina's true form, capable of traveling through and controlling dimensions besides those of time and space. Giratina can only be in its Origin Forme when in its home, the Distortion World, or when holding either a Griseous Orb or Griseous Core. Giratina can also maintain its Origin Forme in the real world without items should it get a sufficient amount of power, enough to potentially be equal to Arceus. Giratina is at its full power when in the Origin Forme, and is always levitated in this state. When in its Origin Forme, it can pass through dimensions at will, although it will turn back to its Altered Forme due to the gravity change from the Distortion World. Giratina has the power to turn itself into a shadow and to merge the Distortion World with the Pok\u00e9mon world, as seen during the events of Spear Pillar. However, this has the dangerous side effect of distorting it to the risk of being destroyed.",
